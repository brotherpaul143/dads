Initial list of todos

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                          CONTENT AND STYLE
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add more terms
* check that the Google search box works
  - on the NIST site, and
  - on the Fastar site
* Style sheet refinements
  - tag for formulas
  - tag for code
  - streamline formatting parameters from hard-coded HTML-tags 
     @ Remove any use of the <font> tag 
     @ Remove remaining modifiers as far as possible. 
     @ Redefine modifiers through using 'clever' style definitions. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                             TOOLS
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* move chkhtml out of the Makefile to a stand-alone perl script and
    run it on Other and Target dirs, in addition to Target/HTML dir.
* update .emacs to search for "by <a href=" and change at that point,
      instead of searching for just "href="
* Start using an issue tracker
* cron script to gather and save visiting statistics
* Auto configure script
  - create the appropriate bits* files
  - add a new make configure* to make
  - make changes to linkchecker 
* bug: mkcommon.pl should make sure the HTML file name assigned to AKA
    and WEB entries is unique. Now it just makes sure they are
    different from term file roots, but it creates the same file names
    for multiset and multi-set (in bag.trm). mkterms detects some
    collisions when it writes the unified index, but would not report
    if, say, alice and bob had AKA eve and *eve (which alphabetize as
    EVE and STAREVE, but both use eve.html).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                          DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* How to guides (including notes on basic use)
  - setup GIT to collaborate 
      Step 1 $ git clone https://github.com/vpieterse/dads
        this step creates a dads directory
  - the files needed and changes needed to create a new configuration
  - setup linkchecking and fixing broken links
  - setup emacs, e.g., to update files upon save

* Conferenece/Journal publications
  - rework of TN that did not succeed 
  - some ideas arising from analysis of visiting stats
  - some ideas arising from update stats

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                             DESIGN
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* Change HTML folder name to Terms

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                            COMMUNITY
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* Recruit collaborators
* Set up a generic fastar e-mail for queries from the public
