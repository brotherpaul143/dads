<p>
This web site is hosted by
include(`Pages/bitsHostedBy.m4')
</p>

<p>
This site is a dictionary of algorithms, algorithmic techniques, 
data structures, archetypal problems, and related definitions.
The <a href="terms.html">main page</a> includes a description
of what subjects are and are not included,
entries for about 1400 terms, and lists of references.
However it is a lot to download if you have a slow
connection or just want to look up one term.  The two-column layout of
the index takes a noticeable amount of time to render, too.
</p>

<p>
The two-level index is very brief.  The first index has links to
secondary index pages, and those link to
the entries.  This two-level approach trades a little less
convenience (two clicks) for a download of about 1/20th the size.
</p>

<p>
There are additional index pages which list entries by 
<a href="termsArea.html">area</a>, for
instance, sorting, searching, or graphs, and by
<a href="termsType.html">type</a>, for example, algorithms or data
structures.
A page also lists all
<a href="termsImpl.html">implementations</a>.
We thank
<a href="Other/contrib.html">those who contributed definitions</a>
as well as many others who offered suggestions and corrections.

<p>
If you don't find a term with a leading variable, such as
<em>n</em>-way, <em>m</em>-dimensional, or <em>p</em>-branching, look
under <em>k</em>-.
