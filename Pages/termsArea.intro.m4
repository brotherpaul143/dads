<p>
This is the web page of terms with definitions organized by area.
That is, whether the term deals with graphs, trees, sorting, etc.
We also list all 
<a href="termsImpl.html">entries with links to implementations</a>
and
<a href="termsType.html">entries by type</a>, for instance, whether it
is an algorithm, a definition, a problem, or a data structure.

<p>
We need people to contribute. include(`Pages/bitsFixDefn.m4'). 
You are welcome to make suggestions to expand and improve the DADS.
