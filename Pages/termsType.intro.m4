<p>
This is the web page of terms with definitions organized by type.
That is, whether the term is an algorithm, a definition, a
problem, or data structure.  We also list all 
<a href="termsImpl.html">entries with links to implementations</a>
and
<a href="termsArea.html">entries by area</a>, for instance, graphs,
trees, sorting, etc.
<p>
We need people to contribute. include(`Pages/bitsFixDefn.m4'). 
You are welcome to make suggestions to expand and improve the DADS.
