After more than a decade of service as author of the DADS, Paul Black co-opted Vreda Pieterse of the <a href="http://www.fastar.org/">FASTAR
group</a> at Stellenbosch University (South Africa), University of Pretoria, and Eindhoven University (Netherlands) as co-author. This site currently runs as a mirror of the original DADS that is still hosted at <a href="http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/">http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/</a>. The older URL http://www.nist.gov/dads/ is an alias which should continue to refer to this URL. We regret any inconvenience this may cause.

Here are some references on algorithms and data structures.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/">Stony Brook
Algorithm Repository</a>, which has algorithms organized by type,
succinct, illustrated definitions, and ratings of sites with
implementations.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/software/AlgAnim/ds_ToC.html">Data
Structures and Algorithms</a> is a wonderful site with illustrations,
explanations, analysis, and code taking the student from arrays and
lists through trees, graphs, and intractable problems.
</p>

<p>
Eric Weisstein's <a

<p>
The <a
href="http://www.spoj.pl/">Sphere
online judge</a> (SPOJ) has about 6600 small programming tasks or puzzles and 
900 contests.  Even nicer it automatically assesses your programs written in 
40 languages.

Sixth International Conference on 
<a href="http://www.dsi.unive.it/~fun2012">Fun
With Algorithms</a> (FUN 2012).  The conference "is
dedicated to the use, design, and analysis of algorithms and data
structures, focusing on results that provide amusing, witty but
nonetheless original and scientifically profound contributions to the
area."
