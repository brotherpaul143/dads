This is the web page of terms with definitions that have links to
implementations with source code.  The language is in
parentheses. We also list all 
<a href="termsType.html">entries by type</a>, for instance, whether it
is an algorithm, a definition, a problem, or a data structure,
and
<a href="termsArea.html">entries by area</a>, for instance, graphs,
trees, sorting, etc.

Don't use this site to cheat.  Teachers, contact us if we can help.

A great source of implementations, organized by area and reviewed for
quality, is the
<a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/">Stony Brook
Algorithm Repository</a>.  A great source of implementations of
mathematical functions is the NIST
<a href="http://gams.nist.gov/">Guide to Available Mathematical
Software</a> or GAMS.
