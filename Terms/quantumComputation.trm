@NOTES=Quantum computers can, in theory, make computations that
are impossible to do exactly with classical computers or achieve
{exponential} speedup.  Since nobody has yet (as of February 2005)
implemented more than a few bit operations, problems such as
decoherence and measurement error may limit quantum computation to a
few specialized roles.
