# the definition
@DEFN=For a given variant of the {Steiner tree} problem, the maximum
possible ratio of the length of a {minimum spanning tree} of a
set of {terminals} to the length of an optimal Steiner tree of
the same set of terminals.  Usually written $\rho$ (rho).

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=In graphs $\rho = 2$.  
In the {Euclidean#Euclidean distance} metric, $\rho = 2/\sqrt\{3}$. 
In the {rectilinear} metric, $\rho = 3/2$.
