@DEFN=The generalized distance between two points.  In a plane with
point
$p<sub>1</sub>$ at $(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)$ and $p<sub>2</sub>$ at
$(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)$, it is 
$(|x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>|<sup>m</sup> + 
 |y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>|<sup>m</sup>)<sup>1/m</sup>$.

@NOTES=This is easily generalized to higher dimensions.
Euclidean distance is $L<sub>2</sub>$ distance.  Rectilinear,
Manhattan or Hamming distance is $L<sub>1</sub>$ distance.  
$L<sub>\infty</sub>$ distance is
$max(|x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>|, |y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>|)$.
