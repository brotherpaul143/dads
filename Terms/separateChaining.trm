# Fix defn: difference between direct and (pure?) separate chaining.

# Revision 1.2  2004/12/01 21:50:49  black
# Change name and defn so this is a collision res. scheme.  Fix defn: it
# uses (several) chains outside the table.  Add BIB entry.  Refine XREFS
# into IMA, etc.  Add RCS keywords.

# the definition
@DEFN=A scheme in which each position in the {hash table} has a
{list} to handle {collisions}.  Each position may be just a {link}
to the list ({direct chaining}) or may be an item and a link,
essentially, the {head} of a list.
In the latter, one item is in the table, and other colliding items
are in the list.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=external chaining
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as name or spelling variants
@WEB=

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={chaining}, {collision resolution scheme}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={direct chaining}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN={hash table}
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME={linked list}
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={coalesced chaining}

# bib refs, eg, to defining article (pure HTML).  printed within <P>..</P>
@BIB=
<strong>Francis A. Williams</strong>, <em>Handling Identifiers as
Internal Symbols in Language Processors</em>,
CACM, 2(6):21-24, June 1959.  Each location in Williams' table an item
and a list head.

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The items in the list may be searched and maintained with any
of the list search algorithms.
Any searchable data structure may be used instead of a list.
