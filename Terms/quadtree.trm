# the definition
@DEFN=A {tree} where each {node} is split along all <em>d</em>
dimensions, leading to 2<sup>d</sup> {children#child}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={octree}, {quadtree complexity theorem}, {linear quadtree}, {BSP-tree}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=It was originally designed for 2-dimensional data (pictures),
so each node had four children, hence <em>quad</em>tree.
