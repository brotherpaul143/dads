@NOTES=If a graph is {connected#connected graph}, it has only one
connected component.
Often the term "component" is used, with the "connected" property understood.

Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph and
$G<sub>1</sub>=(V<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>1</sub>)\ldots, 
G<sub>m</sub>=(V<sub>m</sub>, E<sub>m</sub>)$ 
be its connected components.  Every vertex is in exactly in one
connected component.  
Formally, for all $i \neq j, V<sub>i</sub>\cap V<sub>j</sub>=\emptyset$.
Further, $V=V<sub>1</sub>\cup\ldots\cup V<sub>m</sub>$ and 
$E=E<sub>1</sub>\cup\ldots\cup E<sub>m</sub>$.
