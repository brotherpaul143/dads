# the definition
@DEFN=(1) A {heuristic} {algorithm} to find a near-optimal solution to
the {traveling salesman} problem.  Step 1: find a {minimum spanning
tree} T.  Step 2: find a {perfect matching} M among {vertices#vertex}
with odd
{degree}.  Step 3: combine the {edges} of M and T to make a
{multigraph} G.  Step 4: find an {Euler cycle} in G by skipping
vertices already seen.  (2) An algorithm to find the {chromatic
number} of a graph.
