@DEFN=A fast {priority queue} implementation having N buckets each
with width w, or covering w time.  An item with priority p more
than current goes in bucket (p/w)%N.   Choose N and w to have few
items in each bucket.  Keep items sorted within buckets.  Double
or halve N and change w if the number of items grows or shrinks a lot.
