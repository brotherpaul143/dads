@DEFN=Space decomposition into rectangular cells by overlaying a grid on it.If the cells are congruent (i.e.,of the same width, height, etc.), then the grid is said to be uniform.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."

# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."

# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
