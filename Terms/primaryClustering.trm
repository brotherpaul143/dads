# Revision 1.3  2005/07/18 17:03:41  black
# Refine def'n to better distinguish from secondary clustering.  Change
# file name.

# the definition
@DEFN=The tendency for some {collision resolution schemes} to create
long runs of filled slots near the {hash function} position of {keys}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={secondary clustering}, {clustering free}, {hash table}, {open
addressing}, {clustering}, {linear probing}, {quadratic probing},
{double hashing}, {uniform hashing}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Primary clustering increases average search time.
Linear probing is especially susceptible to primary clustering.
