# the definition
@DEFN=The tendency for some {collision resolution schemes} to create
long runs of filled slots at the {hash function} position.  

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={secondary clustering}, {clustering free}, {hash table}, {open

addressing}, {clustering}, {linear probing}, {quadratic probing},
{double hashing}, {uniform hashing}
# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Primary clustering increases average search time.
Linear probing is especially susceptible to primary clustering.
