@DEFN=A set of items which are randomly accessible by numeric index.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={dynamic array}, {sorted array}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME={array index}, {one-based indexing}, {0-based indexing}
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={associative array}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=An unordered array must be searched with a {linear search}.
Average search time may be improved using a {move-to-front heuristic}
in some cases.
An {external index}, such as a {hash table} or {inverted index} may
help make an {array search} quicker and speed overall processing if
the array is not changed often.
If the array is kept sorted, a {binary search} or {interpolation
search} is faster.
