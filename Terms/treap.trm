# the definition
@DEFN=A {binary search tree} in which {nodes} have another
{key}, called the priority.  Operations also keep the nodes
{heap ordered#heap property} with regard to the priority.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={binary search tree}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={randomized binary search tree}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."

# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."

# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."

# any notes.  these are not printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The name comes from "{tree}" and "{heap}".

<p>
Some call "randomized binary search trees" treaps, but strictly a
treap does not define how priorities are assigned.
