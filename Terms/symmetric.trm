@NOTES=The relation ``not equal to'' is symmetric: if $a \neq
b$, then $b \neq a$.  However, ``loves'' is not symmetric since love
might not be reciprocated.  The relation ``is married to'' is
symmetric, but not {antisymmetric}: if Paul is married to Marlena, then
Marlena is married to Paul (symmetric), but that does not mean that
Paul and Marlena are the same person.
