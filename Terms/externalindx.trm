# the definition
@DEFN=An auxiliary data structure added to a main data structure to
improve operations, such as a {search} on a secondary {key}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={inverted index}, {hash table}, {search tree}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The implementation probably embeds parts of the external
index in the primary data structure, such as adding a few fields to
each {node}.  If items are added to or deleted from the primary data
structure, the external index must be maintained, too.  Data may have
multiple external indexes, such as a data base of movies with inverted
indexes for title, actors, and genre.
