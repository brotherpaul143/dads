# the definition
@DEFN=A maximal subset of {edges} of a {connected graph}
such that the corresponding induced subgraph cannot be disconnected by
deleting any {vertex}.  

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."

# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={connected components}, {biconnected graph}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=That is, the subgraph is {biconnected#biconnected graph} or
has no {cut vertex}.
