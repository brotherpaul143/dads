@DEFN=Generate all nodes in a game tree.  Score each {leaf} node with
its utility value.  Score each minimizing node with the smallest of its  
{children's#child} scores, and maximizing node with the largest of its
children's scores.

@NOTES=For most games, minimizing nodes alternate levels with
maximizing nodes.  This corresponds to two opponents taking turns.

<p>
Conceptually all nodes are generated first, but minimax is
normally implemented as a depth-first search.  Time complexity is
{$O(b<sup>d</sup>)$#big-O notation} where b is the average branching
factor and d is the depth of the move tree.  Complete minimax search
is impractical for most games.
