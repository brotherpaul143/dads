@NOTES=A perfect binary tree has $2<sup>n+1</sup>-1$ nodes, where $n$
is the {height}.
It can be efficiently implemented as an {array}, where a node at index
$i$ has children at indexes $2i$ and $2i+1$ and a
parent at index $i/2$.
After LK.

<p>
A complete binary tree may be seen as a perfect binary
tree with some extra leaf nodes at {depth} $n+1$, all toward the
left.  (After <a href="../terms.html#CLR90">[CLR90, page 140]</a>).
</p>

<p>
This kind of tree is called "complete" by some authors
(<a href="../terms.html#CLR90">[CLR90, page 95]</a>, Leighton)
and "full" by others (Budd page 331, Carrano &amp; Prichard page 429, 
Ege,
<a href="../terms.html#HS83">[HS83, page 225]</a>, and Sahni page 461).
