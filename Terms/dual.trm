# the definition
@DEFN=The dual of a {planar graph}, G, is a {graph} with a
{vertex} for each region in G and an {edge} between vertices for
each pair of adjacent regions.  The new edge crosses the edge in G
which is the boundary between the adjacent regions.

The dual of a planar graph is also planar.  The original graph
is the dual of the dual.  That is, they are duals of each other.
<P>
In the accompanying figure, the black circles and solid lines are one
planar graph.  The white squares and dotted lines are another planar
graph.  Each is the dual of the other.
