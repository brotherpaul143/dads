# the definition
@DEFN=Pack a {set} of rectangles into a strip of width 1 to minimize
the height used.  Rectangles may not overlap or be rotated.  Without
loss of generality, the height of rectangles is at most 1.  This is
{NP-hard}.

@NOTES=
Rectangles must have widths at most 1, otherwise they wouldn't fit in
the strip.  If any height is greater than 1, all heights can be scaled
to no more than 1.
