# the definition
@DEFN=The {complexity class} of {decision problems} that are
intrinsically harder
than those that can be solved by a {nondeterministic Turing machine}
in {polynomial time}.  When a decision version of a
combinatorial {optimization problem} is proved to belong to the class
of {NP-complete} problems, 
then the optimization version is NP-hard.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={unbounded knapsack problem}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={strongly NP-hard}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=For example, "is there a {Hamiltonian cycle} with length less
than k" is
NP-complete: it is easy to determine if a proposed {certificate} has
length less than k.  The optimization problem, "what is the shortest
tour?", is NP-hard, since there is no easy way to determine if a
certificate is the shortest.
</p>

<p>
Another NP-complete problem is to decide if there exist
$k$ {star-shaped polygons} whose union is equal to a given simple
polygon, for some
parameter $k$.  The optimization problem, i.e.,
finding the minimum number (least $k$) of star-shaped polygons whose
union is equal to a given simple polygon, is NP-hard.
