<p>
The above described path is always a {Hamiltonian cycle}, or
tour, however a Hamiltonian cycle need not be optimal.  The problem is
an optimization problem, that is, to find the shortest tour.  The
corresponding {decision problem} asks if there is a tour with a cost
less than some given amount.
See <a href="../terms.html#CLR90">[CLR90, page 969]</a>.
</p>

<p>
If the triangle inequality does not hold, that is $d<sub>ik</sub> &gt;
d<sub>ij</sub> + d<sub>jk</sub>$ for some i, j, k, there is no
possible polynomial time algorithm which guarantees near-optimal
result (unless P=NP).
</p>

<p>
If the triangle inequality holds,
you can quickly get a near-optimal solution by finding the {minimum
spanning tree}.  Convert the tree to a path by traversing the
tree, say by {depth-first search}, but go directly to the next
unvisited node, rather than repeating nodes.  {Christofides algorithm}
starts with a minimum spanning tree, but is more careful about
converting the tree to a path with results closer to optimal.
