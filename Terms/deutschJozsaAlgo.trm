# the definition
@DEFN=A quantum algorithm to determine whether a function is
{constant#constant function} or balanced, that is, returns 1 for half
the {domain} and 0 for the other half.  For a function taking $n$
input qubits, first, do Hadamards on $n$ 0's, forming all possible
inputs, and a single 1, which will be the answer qubit.
Next, run the function once; this {exclusive or#xor}'s the result with
the answer qubit.  Finally, do Hadamards on the $n$ inputs again, and
measure the answer qubit.  If it is 0, the function is constant,
otherwise the function is balanced.

# any notes.  these are not printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The algorithm needs only one (quantum) evaluation of the
function.  A classical algorithm to answer the same question is to
examine one more than half the domain in the {worst case}.
