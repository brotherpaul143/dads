For several years I defined "perfect shuffle" to mean an algorithm that
randomly shuffles (permutes) elements with a uniform chance of getting
any particular permutation.  I now call that an "ideal random
shuffle", after Oleg, since "perfect shuffle" has been far more widely
used for decades to mean the above (see for instance, Donald E. Knuth,
"The Art of Computer Programming", 2nd edition, Vol 3, Exercises for
Sect. 5.3.4, number 13, page 237).
