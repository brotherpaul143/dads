@DEFN=A formal, abstract definition of a computer.  Using a model one
can more easily analyze the intrinsic execution time or memory space
of an {algorithm} while ignoring many implementation issues.  There
are many models of computation which differ in computing power (that
is, some models can perform computations impossible for other models)
and the cost of various operations.
