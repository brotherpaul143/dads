@DEFN=Given $n$ tape drives, one input and $n-1$ work drives,
distribute a portion of the input to $n-2$ tapes, then merge them onto
the final tape reading the $n-2$ backward.  Repeat until $n-2$
(backward) merged runs have been created, at which time they are 
merged.  Continue building up powers of $n-2$ batches until done.
