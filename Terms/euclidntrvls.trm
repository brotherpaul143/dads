# the definition
@DEFN=Find a {path} of minimum {Euclidean distance}
between points in a plane which includes each point exactly once and
returns to its starting point.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."

# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={traveling salesman}, {spanning tree}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=This can be generalized to higher dimensions, for instance,
points in a 3-dimensional space.  This problem is a special case of
traveling salesman since the cost between points is the planar
distance instead of arbitrary weights.
