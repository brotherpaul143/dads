# Improve wording.

# Revision 1.5  2006/06/02 18:19:12  black
# Histogram sort is not a distribution sort, according to the definition.
#
# Revision 1.4  2006/03/27 20:33:31  black
# add a new instance: distributive partitioning sort
#
# Revision 1.3  2005/12/14 21:47:36  black
# IMA sort.  Strand sort is a VARIANT.
#
# Revision 1.2  2004/12/17 15:35:56  black
# Add VARIANT linear probing sort.  Remove subvariants (range sort and
# counting sort).  Refine XREFS into IMA, etc.  Add RCS keywords.

@DEFN=Any {sort} algorithm where items are distributed from
the input to multiple intermediate structures,
which are then gathered and placed on the output.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={sort}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."

# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."

# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS=

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Many distribution sorts are also {merge sorts}
depending on how the distribution is performed.
