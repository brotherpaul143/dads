# the definition
@DEFN=The value which has an equal number of values
greater and less than it.  For an even number of values, it is the
{mean} of the two middle values.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={mean}, {mode}, {midrange}, {Select}, {select and partition}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The median is the "middle" value.  The median of 1, 1, 3, 50,
and 60 is 3 since two elements (1 and 1) are less than it and two
elements (50 and 60) are greater.  The median of 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, and 4
is 2.5, the mean of 2 and 3.
