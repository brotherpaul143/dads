# the definition
@DEFN=For any set $\{\cal H}$ of $n$ hyperplanes in $\Re<sup>k</sup>$,
and any parameter $r, 1 \leq r\leq n$, there always exists a
$(1/r)$-cutting of size $O(r<sup>k</sup>)$.  In two dimensions, a
$(1/r)$-cutting of size $s$ is a partition of the plane into $s$
disjoint triangles, some of which are unbounded, such that no triangle
in the partition intersects more than $n/r$ lines in $\{\cal H}$.  In
$\Re<sup>k</sup>$, triangles are replaced by {simplices#simplex}.
Such a cutting can be computed in $O(nr<sup>k-1</sup>)$ time.
