# the definition
@DEFN=The problem of reaching a consensus among distributed units if
some of them give misleading answers.  To be memorable, the problem is
couched in terms of generals deciding on a common plan of attack.
Some traitorous generals may lie about whether they
will support a particular plan and what other generals told them.
Exchanging only messages, what decision making {algorithm} should the
generals use to reach a consensus?
What percentage of liars can the algorithm tolerate
and still correctly determine a consensus?

@NOTES=The 1975 paper is the first published consideration of the
problem of consensus in the presence of faults that I know of, but the
1982 paper names the
problem.
</p>

<p>
One
variant is: suppose two separated generals will win if both attack at
the same time and lose if either attacks alone, but messengers may be
captured.  If one decides to 
attack, how can that general be sure that the message has reached the
other general and the other general will attack, too?
