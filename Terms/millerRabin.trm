# the definition
@DEFN=A {heuristic} test for prime numbers.  It repeatedly checks if
the number being tested, n, is pseudoprime to a randomly chosen base,
a, and there are only trivial square roots of 1, modulo n.  In other
words, n is surely composite if
$a<sup>n-1</sup> \neq 1 (mod n)$, where $0 &lt; a &lt; n$.  Some
composites may be incorrectly judged to be prime.

@NOTES=For k repetitions, the chance of incorrectly judging an odd
integer greater than 2 to be prime is $2<sup>-k</sup>$.  For randomly
chosen large integers, a small number of repetitions, say 3, is
enough.
