# the definition
@DEFN=A {merge sort} that sorts a data stream using repeated
merges.  It distributes the input into $k$ streams by
repeatedly reading a
{block} of input that fits in memory, called a <em>run</em>, sorting
it, then writing it to the next stream.  It merges runs from the $k$
streams into an output stream.  It then repeatedly distributes the
runs in the output stream to the $k$ streams and merges them
until there is a single sorted output.
