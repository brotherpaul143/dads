# the definition
@DEFN=A propositional, branching-time temporal logic for which
formulas can be checked in {linear} time.  An acronym for Computation 
Tree Logic.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS=

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=CTL differs from CTL* in that in CTL path quantifiers (E and A)
always appear with temporal operators (F, G, X, U, etc.).  Therefore
CTL formulas are <em>state</em> formulas.
