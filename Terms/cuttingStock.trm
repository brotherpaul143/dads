# the definition
@DEFN=Find the best arrangement of shapes on rectangles to minimize
waste or the number of rectangles.  This is a {two-dimensional}
variant of the {bin packing problem}.  It is {NP-complete}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={strip packing} is a one-dimensional variant
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={knapsack problem}, {optimization problem}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=This problem arises often in manufacturing.  For instance,
deciding how to cut pieces for pants from cloth or shapes from sheet
