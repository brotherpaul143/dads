@AREA=search
# the definition
@DEFN=A method of {open addressing} for a {hash table} in which
a {collision} is resolved by searching the table for an empty place at
intervals given by a different hash function, thus minimizing
{clustering}.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=rehashing
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={linear probing}, {hash table}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Since a different hashing function is used to find a location
in case of collision, colliding values should be spread out.  In
{linear probing}, {primary clustering} occurs when collisions fill up
every space for long stretches.  Even in {quadratic probing},
{secondary clustering} may develop since colliding values follow the
same {probe sequence}.
