# the definition
@DEFN=A set of {algorithms} $\{A<sub>\epsilon</sub> | \epsilon &gt; 0\}$, 
where each $A<sub>\epsilon</sub>$ is a $1+\epsilon$-{approximation algorithm}
bounded by a {polynomial} in the length of the input and $1/\epsilon$. 

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."

# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
