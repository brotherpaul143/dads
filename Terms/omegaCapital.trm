# the definition
@DEFN=A theoretical measure of the execution of an {algorithm},
usually the time or memory needed, given the problem size $n$,
which is usually the number of items.  Informally, saying some equation
$f(n) = \Omega (g(n))$ means it is more than some constant multiple of
$g(n)$.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
$f(n) = \Omega (g(n))$
means there are positive constants
$c$ and $k$, such that 
$0 \leq cg(n) \leq f(n)$ for all 
$n \geq k$.
The values of $c$ and $k$ must be fixed for the function
$f$ and must not depend on $n$.

This definition is stronger than the traditional mathematical
definition.  Here, f must be greater than g FOR ALL x bigger than some
k.  The traditional definition is f is big omega of g if
it is not little o of g.  That is, one needs only an unbounded
sequence of values of x tending to infinity such that $cg(x) \leq
f(x)$ for all x in the sequence. <br>
