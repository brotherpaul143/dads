@NOTES=Any computer program is likely to generate pseudo-random
numbers, not actually random numbers.  This is important when, say,
simulations are sensitive to subtle patterns in the ``random'' numbers
used.  Hardware-based random number generators are built from parts
with naturally random events, such as noise in a diode.
</p>

<p>
Pseudorandom number generators are often based on a 
Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG).
</p>

<p>
A generator is often ``seeded'', or initialized, from sources of entropy,
such as the current time in microseconds, response time to a disk
seek, or other random events to give different sequences
every time it is used.
</p>

<p>
Do <strong>NOT</strong> use typical ``random'' number generators for
security or cryptographic purposes.
