# the definition
@DEFN=When the execution time of a computation, $m(n)$, is no more
than a {polynomial} function of the problem size, $n$.
More formally $m(n) = {O(n<sup>k</sup>)#big-O notation}$ where $k$ is
a constant.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names or {cross refs} that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=polynomial-time algorithm

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={sublinear time algorithm}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={NP},{exponential},{logarithmic}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Broadly speaking, polynomial time algorithms are reasonable to
compute.  The time to run exponential algorithms grows too fast to
expect to be able to compute exact solutions in all cases.
