# the definition
@DEFN=The tendency for entries in a {hash table} using {open
addressing} to be stored together, even when the table has ample empty
space to spread them out.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={primary clustering}, {secondary clustering}, {k-clustering},

@NOTES=In machine learning, "clustering" means to group together
objects that are similar, usually to determine meaningful
classes or concepts.  After Keith Cassell, 29 Dec 2005.

<p>
Clustering leads to inefficiency because the chances are higher
that the place you want to put an item is already filled.  The effect
is like having a high {load factor} in the areas with clustering, even
though the overall load factor may be quite low.
