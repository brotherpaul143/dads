# the definition
@DEFN=A file which stores {keys} and an index into another file.  The
index file may have additional structure, e.g., be a {B-tree}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={inverted index}, {forward index}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=An index file is helpful if records are large: the keys and
indexes can be extracted, sorted, and the original file accessed
faster than the original file could be rearranged into sorted order.
Also if the file needs to be accessed by different keys at the same
time, it cannot be sorted by all of them.  So a index file is
maintained for each different key.
