# the definition
@DEFN=A {binary#binary tree} {search tree} in which each {node} uses
an otherwise-empty left {child} {link} to refer to the node's
{in-order#in-order traversal} predecessor and an empty right child
link to refer to its in-order successor.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={right-threaded tree}, {binary search tree}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=
See <a href="../terms.html#Knuth97">[Knuth97, 1:320, Sect. 2.3.1]</a>.
Although the definition could refer to a {multiway tree}, Knuth
defines a threaded tree as a binary tree.
