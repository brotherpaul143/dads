# the definition
@DEFN=A variant of a {trie} in which {leaf} nodes are {buckets} which
hold up to $k$ strings.  Usually implies fixed sized buckets.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={trie}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={elastic-bucket trie}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS=

# bib refs, eg, to defining article (pure HTML).  printed within <p>..</p>

<strong>Edward H. Sussenguth, Jr.</strong>, <em>Use of Tree Structures
for Processing Files</em>, CACM, 6(5):272-279, May 1963.
# On pages 277 and 278 he talks about terminating branching in regular
# trees to eliminate long, sparse chains.  This necessitates "blocks
# of items" or buckets, although he skips allocation, etc. issues.

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Combining terminal strings can greatly shorten branches.
For instance, "extraordinarily", "extraordinariness", and
"extraordinary" can be stored in one bucket at the end of a short
branch distinguishing them from extran... and extrap... rather than a
long branch for the common substring ...ordinar...
</p>

The name comes from re<strong>TRIE</strong>val and is
pronounced, "tree".  See the historical note at {trie}.
