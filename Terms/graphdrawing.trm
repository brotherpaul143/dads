@DEFN=The problem of representing a {graph} in a plane "neatly,"
for instance with a minimum number of {edge crossings}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={grid drawing}, {orthogonal drawing}, {straight-line drawing},
{planar graph}, {planarization}
