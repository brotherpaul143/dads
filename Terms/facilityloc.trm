@DEFN=Given a set of demand points, a distance function, and
a parameter $p$, find a set of $p$ supply objects (points, lines,
segments, etc.) which minimizes some distance {objective function}.
The function may be the maximum distance between any demand point and
the nearest supply, so no demand point is too far from a supply, or
the sum of distances to the nearest supply.
