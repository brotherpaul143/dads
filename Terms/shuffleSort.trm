# the definition
@DEFN=A {distribution sort} algorithm that begins by removing the
first $1/8$ of the $n$ items, sorting them (recursively), and putting them
in an array.  This creates $n/8$ {buckets} to which the
remaining $7/8$ of the items are distributed.  Each bucket is then
sorted, and the buckets are concatenated.

@NOTES=Shuffle sort can be thought of as forming very wide {trees},
like B-tree with $m=n/8$, to sort efficiently in many cases.

<p>
Shuffle sort estimates the distribution of the items to be sorted by
examining the first $n/8$ items.  Distributive partitioning sort
estimates the distribution by approximating the median and linearly
interpolating from the minimum to the median and from the median to
the maximum.
