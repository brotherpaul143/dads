@DEFN=Find the k<sup>th</sup> smallest element of a set.  Two
approaches are a modified {distribution sort} or 
{select and partition}.

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The select-and-partition approximately divides in half the
number of elements that must be considered at each step.  The
modified distribution sort divides by m the number of elements at each
step.  The latter is faster, but the former is more generally
applicable.
