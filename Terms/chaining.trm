# Change defn: chaining may be in the table.  Refine XREFS into IMA,
# etc.  Add xrefs.  Add RCS keywords.

# the definition
@DEFN=A scheme in which {linked lists} handle {collisions} in a {hash
table}.  The two main classes of chaining are {separate chaining}, 
where lists are outside the table, and {coalesced chaining}, where the
lists are within the table.


#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={collision resolution scheme}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={coalesced chaining}, {separate chaining}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME={load factor}
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={open addressing}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Any searchable data structure may be used instead of a linked
list, but it is usually better to expand the hash table, thus lowering
the load factor, and use a simple collision resolution mechanism, like
the linked list.
