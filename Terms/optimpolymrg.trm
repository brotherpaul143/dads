# the definition
@DEFN=A {polyphase merge} which seeks to minimize the number of
merge passes by allocating output runs of each pass to the various output
files.  Since polyphase merging must have a different number of runs
in each file to be efficient, one seeks the optimal way of selecting how
many runs go into each output file.  A series of {kth order
Fibonacci numbers} is one way to select the number of runs.
