# the definition
@DEFN=A {string matching} algorithm that is a variant of the
{Boyer-Moore} algorithm.  It uses two consecutive text characters to
compute the bad character shift.  It is faster when the {alphabet} or
{pattern} is small, but the skip table grows quickly, slowing the
pre-processing phase.
