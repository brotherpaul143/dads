# the definition
@DEFN=The (weight) balance of a tree is the number of {leaves#leaf}
of the left subtree of a tree, denoted |T<sub>l</sub>|, divided
by the total number of leaves of the tree.  Formally, $\rho(T)$
 = |T<sub>l</sub>|/|T|.

@NOTES=The balance of a node is the balance of the (sub)tree rooted at
that node.
