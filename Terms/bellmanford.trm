# the definition
@DEFN=An efficient algorithm to find the {shortest paths}
from a single {source} {vertex} to all other vertexes in a 
{weighted, directed graph}.
Weights may be negative.  
The algorithm initializes the distance to
the source vertex to 0 and all other vertexes to $\infty$.  It then
does $V-1$ passes (V is the number of vertexes) over all {edges}
relaxing, or updating, the distance to the destination of each edge.
Finally it checks each edge again to detect negative weight {cycles},
in which case it returns false.  The time complexity is {O(VE)#big-O
notation}, where E is the number of edges.
