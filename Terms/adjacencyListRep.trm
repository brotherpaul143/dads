# the definition
@DEFN=A representation of a {directed graph} with $n$
{vertices#vertex} using an {array} of $n$ {lists} of vertices.  List
$i$ contains vertex $j$ if there is an {edge} from
vertex $i$ to vertex $j$.  A {weighted graph} may be
represented with a list of vertex/weight pairs.  An {undirected graph}
may be represented by having vertex $j$ in the list for vertex $i$
and vertex $i$ in the list for vertex $j$.

@NOTES=
Suppose we have a directed graph with four vertices.  Here are
adjacency-matrix and adjacency-list representations.  The arrow (-&gt;)
means a link in a list.

One variant is to have an array of columns, rather than rows, with the
list going "down".  The adjacency-list representation is more compact
for a {sparse matrix}.
