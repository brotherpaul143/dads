# Revision 1.12  2010/04/12 17:32:42  black
# Remove Falconer's IMPL - page gone, and I can't find it.
#
# Revision 1.11  2009/04/28 19:04:42  black
# NOTE consistent hashing in Wikipedia.
#
# Revision 1.10  2008/08/18 13:23:55  black
# Remove Kaz's IMPL - it has been off line for at least a month.
#
# Revision 1.9  2008/08/14 16:14:25  black
# Update HTML line break (br) tags to be XML/XHMTL compatible
#
# Revision 1.8  2006/07/25 13:33:03  black
# Add WEB ref: dynamic hash table
#
# Revision 1.7  2006/07/20 17:44:49  black
# Add another, more accessible BIB entry for Larson.
#
# Revision 1.6  2005/02/03 15:01:18  black
# Add VARIANTS linear hashing and spiral storage.  Correct and elaborate
# BIB entries.
#
# Revision 1.5  2004/12/17 17:23:43  black
# Make more XHTML compliant.
#
# Revision 1.4  2004/10/14 20:29:42  black
# Add Falconer's and Kaz's IMPLs.
#
# Revision 1.3  2004/01/08 14:29:23  black
# Move load factor to INME.  Add XREFS to expandable hashing and virtual
# hashing.  Although they should prob. be VARIANTS, until they're
# defined, I'll leave them as XREFS.
#
# Revision 1.2  2004/01/08 13:10:37  black
# Refine XREFS to IMA, etc.  Add extendible hashing as a VARIANT.
# Put correction to Enbody and Du on a new line for emphasis.

# the definition
@DEFN=A {hash table} that grows to handle more items.  The associated
{hash function} must change as the table grows.  Some schemes may
shrink the table to save space when items are deleted.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as name or spelling variants
@WEB=dynamic hash table

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={hash table}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
