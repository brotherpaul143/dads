# the definition
@DEFN=The hash value is the {xor} of values from tables ({arrays})
indexed by characters.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
$h(c) = \oplus<sup>n</sup><sub>i=1</sub> T<sub>i</sub>[c<sub>i</sub>]$,
where $\oplus$ is the {xor} operation,
T<sub>i</sub> is the i<sup>th</sup> table, and
$c<sub>i</sub>$ is the i<sup>th</sup> character.

@NOTES=
The typical hash function is the xor of the representation of
characters, that is,
$h(c) = \oplus<sup>n</sup><sub>i=1</sub> c<sub>i</sub>$.
</p>

<p>
The tables may be filled with random values or may have values chosen
to avoid {collisions} or for other properties.
</p>

<p>
For games, e.g. chess, "characters" are pieces, like pawn, knight, and
queen.
