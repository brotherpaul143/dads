# the definition
@DEFN=A {graph} that can be embedded in the plane without crossings in
which every {edge} in the graph is a straight line segment.  It is
sometimes referred to as planar subdivision or map.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
