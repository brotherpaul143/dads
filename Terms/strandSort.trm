# the definition
@DEFN=A {sort} algorithm that works well if many items are in order.
First, begin a sublist by moving the first item from the original list
to the sublist.  For each subsequent item in the original list, if it
is greater than the last item of the sublist, remove it
from the original list and append it to the sublist.
{Merge} the sublist into a final, sorted list.  Repeatedly extract and
merge 
sublists until all items are sorted.  Handle two or fewer items as
special cases.

@FORML=

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."

# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=

@IMIN={J sort}
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
