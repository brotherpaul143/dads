# the definition
@DEFN=A {heuristic} that moves the target of a {search} to the {root}
of the {search tree} so it is found faster next time.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN={splay tree}
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={move-to-front heuristic}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=This technique speeds up {search} performance only if the
target item is likely to be searched for again soon.
