# the definition
@DEFN=(1) A division of a {set} into nonempty {disjoint sets} that
completely cover the set.  (2) To rearrange the elements of an {array}
into two (or more) groups, typically, such that elements in the first
group are less than a value and elements in the second group are
greater.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
(1) A partition $P$ of a set $S$ is a set of subsets
with the following properties:
<ul>
<li> $\forall s<sub>i</sub> \in P, s<sub>i</sub> \neq \emptyset$ <br />(no
subset is empty),
<li> $\forall s<sub>i</sub>, s<sub>j</sub> \in P, i \neq j \rightarrow
s<sub>i</sub>
\cap s<sub>j</sub> = \emptyset $ <br /> (subsets are disjoint), and
<li> $\bigcup<sub>i=1</sub> s<sub>i</sub> = S$ <br />(subsets exactly
cover the original).
</ul>
