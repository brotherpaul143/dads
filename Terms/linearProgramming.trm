@DEFN=A problem expressible in the following form.  
Given an $n \times m$ real matrix $A$,
$m$-vector $b$ and $n$-vector $c$, determine
$\min<sub>x</sub>\left\{c\cdot x | Ax \geq b \mbox\{and} x \geq
\bar\{0}\right\}$ where $x$ ranges over all $n$-vectors and the
inequalities are interpreted component-wise, i.e., $x \geq \bar\{0}$
means that the entries of $x$ are nonnegative.
