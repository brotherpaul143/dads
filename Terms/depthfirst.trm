# the definition
@DEFN=(1) Any search algorithm that considers outgoing {edges} of
a {vertex} before any neighbors of the vertex, that is, outgoing
edges of the vertex's predecessor in the search.  Extremes are searched
first.  This is easily implemented with {recursion}.  (2) An algorithm
that marks all vertices in a {directed graph} in the order they are
discovered and finished, partitioning the graph into a {forest}.
