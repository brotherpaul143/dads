# the definition
@DEFN=A class of {collision resolution schemes} in which all items are
stored within the {hash table}.  In case of {collision},
other positions are computed and checked (a {probe sequence}) until an
empty position is found.  Some ways of computing possible new
positions are less efficient because of
{clustering}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."

{double hashing}, {uniform hashing}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."

# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."

{expandable hashing}, {perfect hashing}

@NOTES=After <A href="../terms.html#CLR90">[CLR90, page 232]</A>.
Chaining, the use of external data
structures to resolve collisions, has no clustering in the usual
sense.
