@TYPE=S
# basic, numeric, search, sort, graph, combin(atorial), tree, theory
@AREA=tree
# the definition
@DEFN=A nearly-balanced {tree} that uses an extra bit per 
{node} to maintain balance.  No {leaf} is more than twice as far
from the {root} as any other.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
A red-black tree with $n$ internal nodes has {height}
at most $2\log<sub>2</sub>(n+1)$.  
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=symmetric binary B-tree
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={B-tree}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={AVL tree}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME={left rotation}, {right rotation}
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS=
{height-balanced tree}

# bib refs, eg, to defining article (pure HTML).  printed within <p>..</p>
@BIB=
<strong>Rudolf Bayer</strong>, <em>Symmetric Binary B-Trees: Data
Structures and Maintenance Algorithms</em>,
Acta Informatica, 1:290-306, 1972.

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The extra bit "colors" the node red or black, hence the name.
These were called "symmetric binary B-trees" when first invented.  The
red/black naming and explanation was given by Guibas and Sedgewick.

An AVL tree is at least as balanced as a red-black tree.
