# the definition
@DEFN=A {model of computation} consisting of a {finite state machine}
controller, a read-write head, and an unbounded sequential tape.
Depending on the current {state} and symbol read on the tape, the
machine can change its state and move the head to the left or right.
Unless otherwise specified, a Turing machine is {deterministic}.
