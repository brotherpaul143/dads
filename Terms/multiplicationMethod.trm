@DEFN=A {hash function} that uses the first $p$ bits of the {key}
times an irrational number.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=$h(k) = \lfloor m(k A (mod 1))\rfloor$, where $m$ is usually
an integer $2<sup>p</sup>$ and $A$ is an irrational number (or an
approximation thereto) $0 &lt; A &lt; 1$.  The modulo 1
operation removes the integer part of $k \times A$.
