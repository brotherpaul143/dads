# the definition
@DEFN=A {connected#connected graph}, {acyclic#acyclic graph},
{undirected graph}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={tree}, {rooted tree}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary

connected.
