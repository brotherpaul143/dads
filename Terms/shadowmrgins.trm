# the definition
@DEFN=An {algorithm} to insert a new {node} into a {shadow heap}.
The new node is placed in the unordered table.
When the table grows beyond some threshold size, table 
nodes and all their {parents} are reordered so
everything is a heap.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={shadow merge}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=If the threshold size is O(log n), where n is the size of the
heap, insertion is O(log log n), amortized.
