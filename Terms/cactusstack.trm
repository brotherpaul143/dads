# the definition
@DEFN=A variant of {stack} in which one other cactus stack may be
attached to the top.  An attached stack is called a ``branch.''  When
a branch becomes empty, it is removed.  Pop is not allowed if there is
a branch.  A branch is only accessible through the original reference;
it is not accessible through the stack.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=The operations new to this variant of stack, branch(S, T) and
notch(v), may be defined with {axiomatic semantics} as follows.
<ol>
<li>top(branch(S, T)) = top(S)
<li>notch(new()) = false
<li>notch(push(v, S)) = false
<li>notch(branch(S, T)) = true
</ol>
