# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=Given a {graph} $G=(V, E)$, a {subgraph} $S=(V', E')$ is a
maximally connected component if 
<ul>
<li> $S$ is {connected#connected graph}, and
<li> for all vertices $u such that u\in V and u\notin V'$ there is no
vertex $v\in V'$ for which $(u, v)\in E$.
