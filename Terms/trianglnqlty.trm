# the definition
@DEFN=The property that a {complete#complete graph} {weighted graph}
satisfies $\mbox\{weight}(u,v) \leq \mbox\{weight}(u,w)
+\mbox\{weight}(w,v)$ for all {vertices#vertex} $u, v, w$.
Informally, the graph has no short cuts.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS=

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=This holds for any graph representing points in a metric space.
Many problems involving edge-weighted graphs have better approximation
algorithms if the problem is restricted to weights satisfying the
triangle inequality.
