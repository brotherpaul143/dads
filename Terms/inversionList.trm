# the definition
@DEFN=A set of non-overlapping numeric ranges, stored in an {array} in
increasing order.  Items in odd indexes begin ranges, and items in
even indexes are the first number after the ends.
</p>

<p>
Use a form of {binary search} to determine if a number is in any of
the ranges. If the search ends on an odd index (a beginning), the
number is in the set.  If the search ends on an even index (a
just-after-end) or outside the array, it is not in the set.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as name or spelling variants
@WEB=

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={set}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME={array}, {binary search}
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."

@NOTES=
For example, to represent the ranges 10-14, 25, and 37-42, the
inversion list would be:</ br>
10 15 25 26 37 43
</p>

<p>
There are linear algorithms for union, intersection, set difference,
negation, etc.

The term inversion list is also used to refer to storing a sequence of
bits as the numeric position of each switch between 0 and 1 bits. See
<a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~teodor/Algorithm-InversionList-0.03/InversionList.pm">Teodor
Ziatanov's InversionList</a> in Perl.
Some authors refer to {inverted index} as inversion list.
