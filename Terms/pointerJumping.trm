# Revision 1.3  2005/02/04 16:00:51  black
# Rename file to pointerJumping.  Add AKA recursive doubling (and the
# NOTE about why its called that), and remove recursive doubling as a
# separate term.
#
# Revision 1.2  2004/12/17 17:06:30  black
# Refine XREFS into IMA, etc.  Add RCS keywords.

@DEFN=In a linked structure, replacing a pointer with the pointer it
points to.  Used for various algorithms on {lists} and {trees}.

The name "recursive doubling" comes the fact that if all the pointers
are jumped at every step, the pointers cover double the distance with
each {recursion}.<br>
