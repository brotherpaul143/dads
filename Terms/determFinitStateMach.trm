# Change the definition to "at most one" transition, instead of "exactly
# one".  Add research notes as comments.

# the definition
@DEFN=A {finite state machine} with at most one transition for each
symbol and {state}.
# comma-separated list of pure names
@AKA=DFA, deterministic finite automaton
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=deterministic finite state automaton

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={nondeterministic finite state machine}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Some fields, like {model checking}, require (and assume) that
there is <em>exactly one</em> transition for each symbol and state.  
A machine that has <em>at least one</em> transition for
each symbol and state is sometimes called "complete".

# "A DFA has at most one transition ..." Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi,
# and Jeffrey D. Ullman, "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and
# Tools", page 116, 1988.

# "maps to singleton sets" "Algorithms and Theory of Computation
# Handbook", page 24-3.

# The definition must be "at most one" to be consistent with being
# able to make any NFA into a DFA.
