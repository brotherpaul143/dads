# the definition
@DEFN=Every {linear program} has a corresponding linear program called the dual.  It is $\max<sub>y</sub>\left\{b\cdot y | A<sup>T</sup>y \leq c \mbox\{and} y \geq \bar\{0}\right\}$.  For any solution $x$ to the original linear program and any solution $y$ to the dual we have $c \cdot x \geq (A<sup>T</sup> y)<sup>T</sup> x = y<sup>T</sup>(Ax) \geq y \cdot b$.  For optimal $x$ and $y$, equality holds.  For a problem formulated as an {integer linear program}, a solution to the dual of a {relaxation} of the program can serve as {witness}.
