@DEFN=The class of {languages} for which a membership computation
by a {probabilistic Turing machine} halts in {polynomial time} with
the right answer (accept or reject) at least 2/3 of the time.
"BPP" means "<strong>B</strong>ounded error
<strong>P</strong>robability in <strong>P</strong>olynomial" time.
