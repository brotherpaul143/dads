# the definition
@DEFN=An {abstract data type} to efficiently support finding
the item with the highest priority across a series of
operations.  The basic operations are: insert, find-minimum (or
maximum), and delete-minimum (or maximum).  Some implementations also
efficiently
support join two priority queues ({meld}), delete an arbitrary item,
and increase the priority of a item (decrease-key).
