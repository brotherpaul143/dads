@DEFN=This describes a "long hand" or manual method of calculating or
extracting cube roots.  Calculation of a cube root by hand is similar
to long-hand division or manual {square root}.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you need to find the cube root of 55,742,968.
Set up a "division" with the number under the radical.
Mark off triples of digits, starting from the decimal
point and working left.  (The decimal point is a period (.), and
commas (,) mark triples of digits.)
<pre>
         ____________	<br />
       \/ 55,742,968.	<br />
</pre>
Look at the leftmost digit(s) (55 in this case).  What is the largest
number whose cube is less than or equal to it?  It is 3, whose
cube is 27.  Write 3 above, write the cube below
and subtract.
<pre>
         __3_________	<br />
       \/ 55,742,968.	<br />
         -27		<br />
         ----		<br />
          28		<br />
</pre>
Now bring down the next three digits (742).
<pre>
         __3_________	<br />
       \/ 55,742,968.	<br />
         -27		<br />
         ----		<br />
           28742	<br />
</pre>
Coming up with the next "divisor" is more involved than for 
{square roots}.  First bring down 3 times the square of the number on
top ($3 \times 3<sup>2</sup>=27$) leaving room for two more digits
(27_ _).
<pre>
         __3_________	<br />
       \/ 55,742,968.	<br />
         -27		<br />
         ----		<br />
    27_ _) 28742	<br />
</pre>
What is the largest number that we can put in the next position and
multiply
times the divisor and still be less than or equal to what we have?
(Algebraically, what is d such that $d \times 2700 \leq 28742$?)
10 might work (since $10 \times 2700 = 27000$), but we can only use a
single digit, so we'll try 9.
<pre>
         __3___9_____	<br />
       \/ 55,742,968.	<br />
         -27		<br />
         ----		<br />
    27_ _) 28742	<br />
</pre>
The second step in making the divisor is adding 3 times the previous
number on top (3) times the last digit (9) times 10 ($3 \times 3
\times 9 = 81 \times 10 = 810$) and the square of the last digit
($9<sup>2</sup> = 81$).
<pre>
     2700	<br />
      810	<br />
    +  81	<br />
    -----	<br />
     3591	<br />
</pre>
Our new divisor is 3591.  
<pre>
         __3___9_____	<br />
       \/ 55,742,968.	<br />
         -27		<br />
         ----		<br />
     3591) 28742	<br />
</pre>
Multiply by the last digit ($9 \times 3591 = 32319$) and
subtract.  But that is too big!  So we'll try 8 as the next digit
instead.
<pre>
         __3___8_____	<br />
       \/ 55,742,968.	<br />
         -27		<br />
         ----		<br />
    27_ _) 28742	<br />
</pre>
We repeat the second step of adding 3 times the previous
number on top (3) times the last digit (8) times 10 ($3 \times 3
\times 8 = 72 \times 10 = 720$) and the square of the last digit
($8<sup>2</sup> = 64$).
<pre>
     2700	<br />
      720	<br />
    +  64	<br />
    -----	<br />
     3484	<br />
</pre>
Our new divisor is 3484.
<pre>
         __3___8_____	<br />
       \/ 55,742,968.	<br />
         -27		<br />
         ----		<br />
     3484) 28742	<br />
</pre>
Now multiply by the last digit ($8 \times 3484 = 27872$) and
subtract.
<pre>
         __3___8_____	<br />
       \/ 55,742,968.	<br />
         -27		<br />
         ----		<br />
     3484) 28742	<br />
          -27872	<br />
          ------	<br />
             870	<br />
</pre>
We are ready to start over on the next digit.  Bring down the next
three digits.  The divisor starts as 3 times the square of the number
on top ($3 \times 38<sup>2</sup>=4332$) leaving room for two more
digits (4332_ _).
<pre>
         __3___8_____	<br />
       \/ 55,742,968.	<br />
         -27		<br />
         ----		<br />
     3484) 28742	<br />
          -27872	<br />
          ------	<br />
    4332_ _) 870968	<br />
</pre>
It looks like 2 is the next digit.
<pre>
         __3___8___2_	<br />
       \/ 55,742,968.	<br />
         -27		<br />
         ----		<br />
     3484) 28742	<br />
          -27872	<br />
          ------	<br />
    4332_ _) 870968	<br />
</pre>
Add 3 times the previous number on top (38) times the last digit (2)
times 10 ($3 \times 38 \times 2 = 228 \times 10 = 2280$) and the
square of the last digit ($2<sup>2</sup> = 4$).
<pre>
     433200	<br />
       2280	<br />
    +     4	<br />
    -------	<br />
     435484	<br />
</pre>
Our new divisor is 435484.
<pre>
         __3___8___2_	<br />
       \/ 55,742,968.	<br />
         -27		<br />
         ----		<br />
     3484) 28742	<br />
          -27872	<br />
          ------	<br />
    435484 ) 870968	<br />
</pre>
Now multiply by the last digit ($2 \times 435484 = 870968$) and
subtract.
<pre>
         __3___8___2_	<br />
       \/ 55,742,968.	<br />
         -27		<br />
         ----		<br />
     3484) 28742	<br />
          -27872	<br />
          ------	<br />
    435484 ) 870968	<br />
            -870968	<br />
            -------	<br />
                  0	<br />
</pre>
</p>

<p>
So the cube root of 55742968 is 382.  You can continue
to get as many decimal places as you need: just bring
down more triples of zeros.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Why does this work?</strong>
</p>

<p>
Consider $(10A + B)<sup>3</sup> = 1000A<sup>3</sup> +
3 \times 100A<sup>2</sup>B + 3 \times 10AB<sup>2</sup> +
B<sup>3</sup>$ and think about finding the volume of a cube.
</p>

<p>
The volume of the three thin plates is $3 \times 100A<sup>2</sup>B$.
The volume of the three skinny sticks is $3 \times 10AB<sup>2</sup>$.
The tiny cube is $B<sup>3</sup>$.
If we know A and the volume of the cube, S, what B should we
choose?  
</p>

<p>
We previously subtracted $A<sup>3</sup>$ from S.  To scale to
$1000A<sup>3</sup>$, we bring down three more digits 
(a factor of 1000) of the length of S.  We write down 3 times A
squared ($3A<sup>2</sup>$),
but shifted two places ($100 \times 3A<sup>2</sup>$ or 
$3 \times 100A<sup>2</sup>$).  We estimate B.  We add 30 times A times B
($30 \times AB$ or $3 \times 10AB$) and B squared.
Multiplying that by B gives us 
$3 \times 100A<sup>2</sup>B + 3 \times 10AB<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>3</sup>$.
When we subtract that from the remainder (remember we
already subtracted $A<sup>3</sup>$), we have subtracted exactly
$(10A + B)<sup>3</sup>$.  That is, we have improved our knowledge
of the cube root by one digit, B.
</p>
<p>
We take whatever remains, scale again by 1000, by bringing down three
more digits, and repeat the process.
