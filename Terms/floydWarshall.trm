# the definition
@DEFN=An algorithm to solve the {all pairs shortest path} problem in a
{weighted, directed graph} by multiplying an {adjacency-matrix
representation} of the graph multiple times.  The edges may have
negative weights, but no negative weight {cycles}.
The time complexity is {$\Theta (V<sup>3</sup>)$#\Theta}.
