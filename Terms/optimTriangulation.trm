# the definition
@DEFN=Find the triangulation with the greatest overall minimum angle.
There is an incremental algorithm that takes {$O(n \log n)$#big-O
notation} time.

@NOTES=Triangulation is breaking up an area into triangles.  The goal
is to make all the triangles as close to equilateral as possible.
Equivalently, have as few "slivers" as possible.

<p>
This is the best triangulation if you want to interpolate
a height field (topographic map) between given points, or to divide a
surface to triangles and research the heat conduction, etc. between
them.  Contributed by Motty Porat (vn16908@netvision.net.il) 10 July
