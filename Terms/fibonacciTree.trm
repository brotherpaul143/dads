# the definition
@DEFN=A variant of a {binary tree} where a tree of order $n$ ($n>1$)
has a left subtree of order $n-1$ and a right subtree of order $n-2$.  An
order 0 Fibonacci tree has no {nodes}, and an order 1 tree has 1 node.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={binary tree}, {AVL tree}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN={Fibonaccian search}
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME={Fibonacci number}
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS=

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=A Fibonacci tree of order $n$ has $F(n+2)-1$ nodes, where
$F(n)$ is the $n<sup>th</sup>$ {Fibonacci number}.  A Fibonacci tree
is the most unbalanced {AVL tree} allowed.
