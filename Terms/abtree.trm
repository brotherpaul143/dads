# the definition
@DEFN=A {search tree} with the restrictions that all {leaves#leaf} are
at the same {depth} and all {internal nodes} have between $a$ and $b$
{children#child}, where $a$ and $b$ are integers such that 
$2 \leq a \leq (b+1)/2$.  
The {root} may have as few as 2 children.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={search tree}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={B-tree} with $1 \leq a$
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
