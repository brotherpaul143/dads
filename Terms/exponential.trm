# the definition
@DEFN=(1) Any function which is the sum of constants times other
constants to the power of
the argument:
$f(x)=\Sigma<sub>i=0</sub><sup>k</sup> c<sub>i</sub>b<sub>i</sub><sup>xp<sub>i</sub></sup>$.
(2) In complexity theory, the measure of computation, $m(n)$ (usually
execution time or memory space), is bounded by an exponential
function of the problem size, $n$.  More formally if there exists
$k &gt; 1$ such that $m(n) = {\Theta(k<sup>n</sup>)#\Theta}$ and
there exists $c$ such that $m(n) = {O(c<sup>n</sup>)#big-O notation}$.
