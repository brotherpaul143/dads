# the definition
@DEFN=The transitive reduction of a {directed graph} G is the
directed graph G' with the smallest number of {edges} such that
for every {path} between {vertices#vertex} in G, G' has a path
between those vertices.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={reduced digraph}, {transitive closure}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Informally G' is the minimal graph with the same connectivity as G.
