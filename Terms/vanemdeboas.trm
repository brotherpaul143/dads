@DEFN=An efficient implementation of {priority queues} where insert,
delete, get minimum, get maximum, etc. take 
{O(log log N)#big-O notation} time, where N is the total possible
number of {keys}.  Depending on the circumstance, the implementation
is null (if the queue is empty), an integer (if the queue has one
integer), a {bit vector} of size N (if N is small), or a special {data
structure}: an {array} of priority queues, called the bottom queues,
and one more priority queue of array indexes of the bottom queues.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
