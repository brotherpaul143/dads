# the definition
@DEFN=An optimization for which given any instance of the problem and
integer $\lambda &gt;0$, there is an easily computed second instance
that is the same except that the {objective function} for the second
instance is (element-wise) $\lambda$ times the objective function of
the first instance.  For such problems, the best one can hope for is a
{relative performance guarantee}, not an {absolute performance
guarantee}.
