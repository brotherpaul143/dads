# the definition
@DEFN=A {randomized algorithm} that always produces correct results,
with the only variation from one run to another being its running
time.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={randomized algorithm}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={skip list} insert,
{Quicksort} variants that pick the pivot randomly, 
{random search}, {Grover's algorithm}, 
Czech, Havas, and Majewski's {order-preserving minimal perfect hashing}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={Monte Carlo algorithm}, {ZPP}

A Monte Carlo algorithm gives more precise results the longer you run
it.  A Las Vegas algorithm always gives the right answer, but the run
time is indeterminate.
