# the definition
@DEFN=A {binary tree} where every {node's#node} left 
{subtree} has {keys} less than the node's key, and every right
subtree has keys greater than the node's key.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={binary tree}, {search tree}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={AVL tree}, {splay tree}, {threaded tree}, 
{randomized binary search tree}, {discrete interval encoding tree}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN={treesort (1)}
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={relaxed balance}, {ternary search tree}, 
{move-to-root heuristic}, {jump list}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=A binary search tree is almost always implemented with
pointers, but may have a variety of constraints on how it is composed.
