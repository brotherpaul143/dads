@DEFN=A {sort} algorithm that builds a {heap}, then
repeatedly extracts the maximum item.  Run time is 
{O(n log n)#big-O notation}.

@BIB=
<strong>Robert W. Floyd</strong>, <em>Algorithm 245 Treesort 3</em>,
CACM, 7(12):701, December 1964.<br />
<strong>J. W. J. Williams</strong>, <em>Algorithm 232 Heapsort</em>,
CACM, 7(6):378-348, June 1964.<br />
Although Williams clearly stated the idea of heapsort, Floyd gave a
complete, efficient implementation nearly identical to what we use
today.

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Heapsort can be seen as a variant of {selection sort} in which
sorted items are arranged (in a {heap}) to quickly find the next item.
</p>

<p>
Some times called "tournament sort" by analogy between a heap, with
its {heap property}, and a tree of matches in a sports tournament.
