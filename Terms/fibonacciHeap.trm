# the definition
@DEFN=A {heap} made of a {forest} of {trees}.  The {amortized cost} of
the operations create, insert a value, decrease a value, find minimum,
and merge or join ({meld}) two heaps, is a constant
{$\Theta(1)$#$\Theta$}.  The delete operation takes {$O(\log n)$#big-O
notation}.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as name or spelling variants
@WEB=Fibonnaci heap

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={heap}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN={priority queue}, {Dijkstra's algorithm}
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS=

# bib refs, eg, to defining article (pure HTML).  printed within <p>..</p>
@BIB=
