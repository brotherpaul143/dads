# the definition
@DEFN=Randomly permute $N$ elements by exchanging each element
$e<sub>i</sub>$ with a random element from $i$ to $N$.
It consumes {$\Theta(N \log N)$#$\Theta$} bits and runs in
{linear} time.

<strong>R. A. Fisher</strong> and <strong>F. Yates</strong>,
Example 12, Statistical Tables, London, 1938.<br />
<strong>Richard Durstenfeld</strong>, <em>Algorithm 235: Random
permutation</em>, CACM 7(7):420, July 1964.

# any notes.  these are not printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The algorithm can be viewed as a reverse {selection
sort}.  It is described in some detail as algorithm 3.4.2P in 
<a href="../terms.html#Knuth97">[Knuth97, 2:145]</a>.
</p>

<p>
For even a rather small number of elements (or cards), the total
number of permutations is far larger than the period of most
pseudo-random number generators.  This implies that most permutations
will never be generated.  (After documentation for random.shuffle() in
Python, particularly v2.6.1.)

# I first saw it called the Fisher-Yates shuffle in Perl Cookbook,
# recipe 4.17.  The bib info came from Knuth.  I verified the CACM
# ref.
