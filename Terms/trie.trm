@NOTES=The name comes from re<strong>TRIE</strong>val and is
pronounced, "tree".  See the historical note.

</p> 
There are many who, in an attempt to verbally
distinguish a trie from the more general tree and in contrast to
typical English pronunciation (of which calorie, eerie, and reverie
are examples, but die, lie, and pie are not), pronounce the name
"try".

As defined by me,
nearly 50 years ago, it is properly pronounced "tree" as in the word
"retrieval".  At least that was my intent when I gave it the name
"Trie".  The idea behind the name was to combine reference to both the
structure (a tree structure) and a major purpose (data storage and
retrieval).
# It's fascinating to see various authorities claiming it
# should be pronounced like "try" but they are only parroting each other.
# Of course, the English language is free to evolve in any direction
# whatsoever.
