# Revision 1.5  2004/06/10 13:50:32  black
# Change edit distance to Levenshtein distance.  The entry changed some
# time ago, but I must have missed this one.
#
# Revision 1.4  2004/04/16 12:40:20  black
# Change encode to code.
#
# Revision 1.3  2004/04/16 12:30:26  black
# Change name to "phonetic coding" since most algorithm encode a string
# (and matching is done by a simple string match).  Add caverphone.  Add
# phonetic encoding as another web search name.
#
# Revision 1.2  2004/04/15 23:10:38  black
# Add "phonetic coding" as a synonym.

@NOTES=
Because spelling variants of names are common in English,
algorithms have been developed to code names based on how
they sound.  Searching and matching is done by converting a name to
some phonetic coding, and comparing codings.
If I type "Hansen" into my electronic telephone book, it is useful for
it to offer "Hanson" as a possible match.

<P>
{Levenshtein distance} and other measures or algorithms allowing for
spelling errors
usually have sophisticated matching routines, rather than
preprocessing the names.
