# the definition
@DEFN=A point that is not part of the input set of points, for
instance, a point computed to construct a {Steiner tree}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS=

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Also called a {Steiner point}.
<p>
Consider the three points of a triangle.  The shortest tree connecting
all three, called the {Steiner tree}, branches out from a fourth point
in the middle.  That middle point, which was not given initially and
must be computed in order to build
the shortest tree, is a Steiner point.
