# the definition
@DEFN=A theoretical measure of the execution of an {algorithm},
usually the time or memory needed, given the problem size $n$,
which is usually the number of items.  Informally, saying some equation
$f(n) = O(g(n))$ means it is less than some constant
multiple of $g(n)$.    
The notation is read, "f of n is big oh of g of n".
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
$f(n) = O(g(n))$
means there are positive
constants $c$ and $k$, such that 
$0 \leq f(n) \leq cg(n)$ for all
$n \geq k$.
The values of $c$ and $k$ must be fixed for the function
$f$ and must not depend on $n$.

@NOTES=
As an example, $n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 4$ is $O(n<sup>2</sup>)$,
since n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 4 &lt; 2n<sup>2</sup> for all $n
&gt; 10$.  Strictly speaking, 3n + 4 is $O(n<sup>2</sup>)$, too, but
big-O notation is often misused to mean equal to rather than less than.
The notion of "equal to" is expressed by {$\Theta(n)$#\Theta}.

The importance of this measure can be seen in trying to decide whether
an algorithm is adequate, but may just need a better implementation,
or the algorithm will always be too slow on a big enough input.  For
instance, {quicksort}, which is O(n log n) on average, running on
a small desktop computer can beat {bubble sort}, which is
O(n<sup>2</sup>), running on a supercomputer if there are a lot of
numbers to sort.  To sort 1,000,000 numbers, the quicksort takes
20,000,000 steps on average, while the bubble sort takes
1,000,000,000,000 steps!
</p>

<p>
Any measure of execution must implicitly or explicitly refer to some
computation model.  Usually this is some notion of the limiting
factor.  For one problem or machine, the number of
floating point multiplications may be the limiting factor, while for
another, it may be the number of messages passed across a network.
Other measures which may be important are compares, item moves,
disk accesses, memory used, or elapsed ("wall clock") time.

Strictly, the character is the upper-case Greek letter Omicron, not
the letter O, but who can tell the difference?
