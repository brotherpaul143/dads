# the definition
@DEFN=A theoretical measure of the execution of an {algorithm},
usually the time or memory needed, given the problem size $n$,
which is usually the number of items.  Informally, saying some equation
$f(n) = O(g(n))$ means it is less than some constant
multiple of $g(n)$.    
The notation is read, "f of n is big oh of g of n".
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
$f(n) = O(g(n))$
means there are positive
constants $c$ and $k$, such that 
$0 \leq f(n) \leq cg(n)$ for all
$n \geq k$.
The values of $c$ and $k$ must be fixed for the function
$f$ and must not depend on $n$.

@NOTES=
As an example, $n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 4$ is $O(n<sup>2</sup>)$,
since n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 4 &lt; 2n<sup>2</sup> for all $n
&gt; 10$ (and many smaller values of n).  
Strictly speaking, 3n + 4 is $O(n<sup>2</sup>)$, too, but
big-O notation is often misused to mean "equal to" rather than "less than".
The notion of "equal to" is expressed by {$\Theta(n)$#\Theta}.

The importance of this measure can be seen in trying to decide whether
an algorithm is adequate, but may just need a better implementation,
or the algorithm will always be too slow on a big enough input.  For
instance, {quicksort}, which is O(n log n) on average, running on
a small desktop computer can beat {bubble sort}, which is
O(n<sup>2</sup>), running on a supercomputer if there are a lot of
numbers to sort.  To sort 1,000,000 numbers, the quicksort takes
20,000,000 steps on average, while the bubble sort takes
1,000,000,000,000 steps!  
See <strong>Jon Bentley</strong>, <em>Programming Pearls: Algorithm
Design Techniques</em>, CACM, 27(9):868, September 1984
for an example of a microcomputer running BASIC beating a
supercomputer running FORTRAN.

<p>
Any measure of execution must implicitly or explicitly refer to some
computation model.  Usually this is some notion of the limiting
factor.  For one problem or machine, the number of
floating point multiplications may be the limiting factor, while for
another, it may be the number of messages passed across a network.
Other measures that may be important are compares, item moves,
disk accesses, memory used, or elapsed ("wall clock") time.

This notation was introduced by Paul Bauchmann in his "Analytische
Zahlentheorie" (1894).  "... the O is apparently derived from the
German word "Ordnung" (meaning 'order')." (Ivan Panchenko, private
communication, 6 September 2019)
# Panchenko points out that Knuth typesets Greek capital letters in
# roman (upright) font, and the O is in italic. For example, "The Art
# of Computer Programming", vol. 1, bottom of page 110.  He also uses
# the phrases "Big Omega" and "Big Theta", but only "O-notation",
# never "Big Omicron".  Knuth's "Big Omicron and big Omega and big
# Theta" never uses "omicron" in the body, only in the title. 
It is capital "O", not the capital Greek letter Omicron.
