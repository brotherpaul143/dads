# the definition
@DEFN=A representation of a {directed graph} with $n$
{vertices#vertex} using an $n \times n$ {matrix}, where the entry at
$(i,j)$ is 1 if there is an {edge} from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$;
otherwise the entry is 0.  A {weighted graph} may be
represented using the weight as the entry.  An {undirected graph}
may be represented using the same entry in both $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$ or
using an {upper triangular matrix}.

@NOTES=
Suppose we have a directed graph with four vertices.  Here are
adjacency-matrix and adjacency-list representations.  The arrow (-&gt;)
means a link in a list.

1  1 1 1 1<br />
2  1 0 0 0<br />
3  0 1 0 1<br />
4  0 1 1 0<br />

2  -&gt; 1<br />
3  -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4<br />
4  -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3<br />
</pre>

<p>
The adjacency-list representation is more compact for a {sparse matrix}, although a
{k$<sup>2</sup>$-tree} can represent a sparse matrix very efficiently.
