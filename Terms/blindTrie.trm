# the definition
@DEFN=A specialized {Patricia tree} whose {internal nodes} store only
an integer, $k$, which is the length of the common {prefix} of the
strings in the {children#child}.  Equivalently, the strings first
differ in the $(k+1)<sup>st</sup>$ character.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."

<em>The string B-tree: a new data structure for string search in
external memory and its applications</em>,
Journal of the ACM, 46(2): 236 - 280, (March 1999).

Called "blind trie" in<br />

@NOTES=
Used in a specialized algorithm, described in <em>Engineering a
Lightweight Suffix Array Construction Algorithm</em>, to build {suffix
arrays}.

The name comes from re<strong>TRIE</strong>val and is
pronounced, "tree."  See the historical note at {trie}.
