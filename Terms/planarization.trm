# the definition
@DEFN=The process of transforming a {graph} into a {planar graph}.
More formally, the transformation involves either removing edges
(planarization by edge removal), or replacing pairs of nonincident
edges by 4-starts (planarization by adding crossing {vertices#vertex}).  In
both cases, the aim of planarization is minimize the number of edge
removals or replacements.
