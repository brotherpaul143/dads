# the definition
@DEFN=A {tree} where every {subtree} of a {node} has {keys} less than
any other subtree of the node to its right.  The keys in a {node}
are conceptually between subtrees and are greater than any keys in
subtrees to
its left and less than any keys in subtrees to its right.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
