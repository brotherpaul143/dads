# the definition
@DEFN=(1) In a {binary search tree}, pushing a {node} N down and to
the right to {balance} the tree.  N's left {child} replaces N, and the
left child's right child becomes N's left child.
(2) In an {array}, moving all items to the next higher location.  The
last item is moved to the first location, which is now vacant.
(3) In a {list}, removing the {tail} and inserting it at the
{head}.
