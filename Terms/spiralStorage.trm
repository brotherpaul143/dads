# the definition
@DEFN=A {dynamic hashing} table that grows a few slots at a time.  It
uses a {hash function}, $h$, with a {range} of $[0,1)$.  For a key,
$k$, an intermediate value, $x=\lceil S-h(k)\rceil +h(k)$, is computed
to find the final slot, $\lfloor d<sup>x</sup>\rfloor$, where $d&gt;1$
is called the growth factor.  To increase the number of slots,
increase $S$ to $S'$ and rehash any keys from 
$\lfloor d<sup>S</sup>\rfloor$ to $\lfloor d<sup>S'</sup>\rfloor-1$.

# any notes.  these are not printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Choosing $d=2$ and $S=\log<sub>2</sub>N$, the number of slots,
every expansion retires one slot and creates two new slots.  Since
slots in use go from $\lfloor d<sup>S</sup>\rfloor$ to 
$\lfloor d<sup>S+1</sup>\rfloor-1$, they are usually remapped to
physical storage.
