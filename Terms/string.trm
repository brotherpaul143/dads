# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."

@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={string matching}, {string matching with errors}, 
{longest common subsequence}, {end-of-string}, {text}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The term string usually refers to a small sequence of characters,
