reminder." [The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,

<p>
A naive program to compute {Fibonacci numbers} is
<pre>
fib(n) \{<br />
   if n is 1 or 2, return 1;<br />
   return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);<br />
}
</pre>
Because fib() is recomputed over and over for the same argument, run
time for the above is ${\Omega}(1.6<sup>n</sup>)$.
If instead we memoize (save) the value of fib(n) the first time we
compute it, the run time is ${\Theta}(n)$.
<pre>
allocate array for memo;<br />
set all elements of memo to zero;<br />
<br />
fib(n) \{<br />
   if n is 1 or 2, return 1;<br />
   if memo[n] is not zero, return memo[n];<br />
   memo[n] = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);<br />
   return memo[n];<br />
}
</pre>
<p>
Of course, computing Fibonacci numbers can be easily done in {logarithmic}
time (see {Fibonacci numbers}), but this illustrates memoization.
