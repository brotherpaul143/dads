# Add new entries: primitive algorithm and compound algorithm
# 
# Revision 1.4  2007/01/10 15:55:39  black
# add oblivious algorithm as VARIANT
#
# Revision 1.3  2004/12/17 17:27:39  black
# Make more XHTML compliant.
#
# Revision 1.2  2004/05/21 13:52:06  black
# Refine XREFS into IMA, etc.  Add another misspelling to WEB.  Add
# heuristic as a VARIANT.
