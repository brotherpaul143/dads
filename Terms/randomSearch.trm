# any notes.  these are not printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=If any item with a certain value is needed and there are many
items with that value, a random search has lower expected time than
linear search.  If parallel processing is available, random search is
fault tolerant (processors may stop working without causing failure)
and reasonably efficient.
