# the definition
@DEFN=One whose associated {language} is a {recursively enumerable language}.  Equivalently, there exists an {algorithm} that halts and outputs 1 for every instance having a ``yes'' answer, but for instances having a ``no'' answer is allowed either not to halt or to halt and output 0.
