@TYPE=P
# basic numeric search sort graph combin(atorial) tree theory para(llel)
@AREA=graph
# the definition
@DEFN=Find the shortest {path} from each {vertex} in a {weighted,
directed graph} to a specific destination vertex.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={graph}, {all pairs shortest path}, {single-source

shortest-path problem}, {DAG shortest paths}, {shortest path}
# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Equivalent to the single-source shortest-path problem with
all directions reversed.

@LINKS=
# implementation(s) (pure HTML)
@IMPL=See implementations at graph.
