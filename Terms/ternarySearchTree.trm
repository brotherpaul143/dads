# the definition
@DEFN=A 3-way {tree} where every {node's#node} left 
{subtree} has {keys} less than the node's key, every middle subtree
has keys equal to the node's key, and every right subtree has keys
greater than the node's key.  If the key is a multikey ({string},
array, list, etc.), the middle subtree organizes by the next subkey
(character, array or list item, etc.)
