# the definition
@DEFN=Find a solution by trying one of
several choices.  If the choice proves incorrect, computation
<em>backtracks</em> or restarts at the point of choice and tries
another choice.  It is often convenient to maintain choice points and
alternate choices using {recursion}.

An early exposition of this technique:
# We'd call this depth-first search with pruning of infeasible solutions.

"This rather universal method was named 'backtrack' by Professor
D. H. Lehmer of the University of California at Berkeley."
# article goes on to say "Backtrack
# has been independently 'discovered' and applied by many people.  A
# fairly general exposition of backtrack was given by R. J. Walker [11]."

@NOTES=Conceptually, a backtracking algorithm does a {depth-first
search} of a {tree} of possible (partial) solutions.  Each choice is a
{node} in the tree.
