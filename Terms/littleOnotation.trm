# the definition
@DEFN=A theoretical measure of the execution of an {algorithm},
usually the time or memory needed, given the problem size $n$,
which is usually the number of items.  Informally, saying some equation
$f(n) = o(g(n))$ means $f(n)$ becomes insignificant relative to $g(n)$
as $n$ approaches infinity.  
The notation is read, "f of n is little oh of g of n".
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
$f(n) = o(g(n))$
means for all $c &gt; 0$
there exists some $k &gt; 0$ such that
$0 \leq f(n) &lt; cg(n)$ for all
$n \geq k$.
The value of $k$ must not depend on $n$, but may depend on $c$.

@NOTES=
As an example, $3n + 4$ is $o(n<sup>2</sup>)$ 
since for any $c$ we can choose 
$k &gt; (3+\sqrt\{9+16c})/2c$.  $3n + 4$ is not $o(n)$.
$o(f(n))$ is an upper bound, but is not an
{asymptotically tight bound}.
