# the definition
@DEFN=A way to represent a {multiway tree} as a {binary tree}.  The
leftmost {child}, $c$, of a {node}, $n$, in the multiway tree is the
left child, $c'$, of the corresponding node, $n'$, in the binary tree.
The immediately right {sibling} of $c$ is the right child of $c'$.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
A multiway tree $T$ can be represented by a corresponding binary tree
$B$.
Let $\{n<sub>1</sub>,\ldots, n<sub>k</sub>\}$ be nodes of the multiway
tree, $T$.  Let $\{n'<sub>1</sub>,\ldots, n'<sub>k</sub>\}$ be nodes of
the corresponding binary tree $B$.  
Node $n<sub>k</sub>$ corresponds to $n'<sub>k</sub>$.  In particular, 
nodes $n<sub>k</sub>$ and $n'<sub>k</sub>$ have the same labels and
if $n<sub>k</sub>$ is the root of $T$, $n'<sub>k</sub>$ is the root of
$B$.
Connections correspond as follows:
</P>

<ul>
<li>If $n<sub>l</sub>$ is the leftmost child of $n<sub>k</sub>$,
$n'<sub>l</sub>$ is the left child of $n'<sub>k</sub>$.
(If $n<sub>k</sub>$ has no children, $n'<sub>k</sub>$ has no left
child.)

<li>If $n<sub>s</sub>$ is the next (immediately right) sibling of
$n<sub>k</sub>$, $n'<sub>s</sub>$ is the right child of
$n'<sub>k</sub>$.

</ul>

<P>
The {binary tree} representation of a {multiway tree} is based on
first child-next sibling representation of the tree. In this
representation every node is linked with its leftmost child and its
next (right nearest) sibling. 
</P>

<P>
Let us see one example.  Consider the following multiway tree

<pre>
                 1           <br>
                /|\          <br>
               / | \         <br>
              /  |  \        <br>
             2   3   4       <br>
            / \      |       <br>
           5   6     7       <br>
                    / \      <br>
                   8   9     <br>
</pre>

This tree can be represented in first child-next sibling manner
as follows

<pre>
                 1           <br>
                /            <br>
               /             <br>
              /              <br>
             2---3---4       <br>
            /       /        <br>
           5---6   7         <br>
                  /          <br>
                 8---9       <br>
</pre>

Now, if we look at the first child-next sibling representation of the
tree closely, we will see that it forms a binary tree.  To see this better,
we can rotate every next-sibling edge 45 degrees 
clockwise.  After that we get the following binary tree:

<pre>
               1             <br>
              /              <br>
             2               <br>
            / \              <br>
           5   3             <br>
            \   \            <br>
             6   4           <br>
                /            <br>
               7             <br>
              /              <br>
             8               <br>
              \              <br>
               9             <br>
</pre>

This is binary tree representation of the given (multiway) tree.
