# the definition
@DEFN=A {total function} which can be written using only nested
conditional (if-then-else) statements and fixed iteration (for)
loops.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={computable}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES={Ackermann's function} is {computable}, but is not
primitive recursive.  Primitive recursion functions always
terminate.  More powerful languages have some functions which cannot
be proved to either terminate or run forever.
