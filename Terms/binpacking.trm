# the definition
@DEFN=Determine how to put the most objects in the least number of
fixed space bins.  More
formally, find a {partition} and assignment of a {set} of objects such
that a constraint is
satisfied or an {objective function} is minimized (or maximized).
There are many variants, such as, 3D, 2D, linear, pack by volume, pack
by weight, minimize volume, maximize value, fixed shape objects, etc.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}

# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."

# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={knapsack problem}, {cutting stock problem}, {optimization

problem}, {strip packing}, {set packing}
# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=A common form of the problem is, what is the least number of
bins (containers of fixed volume) needed to hold a set of objects.
This problem often appears in manufacturing.  For instance, suppose we
need a number of pipes of different, specific lengths to plumb a
house and we can buy pipe stock in 5 meter lengths.  How can we cut
the 5-meter pipes to waste as little as possible (minimize the cost of
pipe)?
