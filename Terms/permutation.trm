# Move the good algorithm to randomly permute elements to its own (new)
# entry: it is called the Fisher-Yates shuffle.  Move Ben Pfaff's
# shuffle implementation there.

# Revision 1.2  2004/03/30 17:19:19  black
# Refine XREFS into IMA, etc.  Refer to Ben Pfaff's shuffle impl.

@TYPE=A
# basic numeric search sort graph combin(atorial) tree theory para(llel)
@AREA=combin
# the definition
@DEFN=A rearrangement of elements, where none are lost, added, or
changed.  The {Fisher-Yates shuffle} randomly permutes elements.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names or {cross refs} that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=shuffle
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=permute

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={combination}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={perfect shuffle}, {Fisher-Yates shuffle}, {sort}, {derangement}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN={American flag sort}
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME={Johnson-Trotter}
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={pseudo-random number generator}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=A {sort} is a permutation where the items are arranged in some
order.
