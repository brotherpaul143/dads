# the definition
@DEFN=Find the weight (or length) of the {shortest paths}
between all pairs of {vertices#vertex} in a {weighted, directed
graph}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."

# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={Floyd-Warshall algorithm}, {Johnson's algorithm}
{Dijkstra's algorithm}, {Bellman-Ford algorithm},
similar problems: {shortest path}, {minimum spanning tree}, 
{traveling salesman}, {all simple paths}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The problem is to find the weights of the shortest paths
between all pairs of vertices.  For a map, it is to produce the
(shortest) road distances between all cities, not which roads to take
to get from one city to another.
