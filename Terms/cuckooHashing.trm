# the definition
@DEFN=A {dictionary} implemented with two {hash tables},
$T<sub>1</sub>$ and $T<sub>2</sub>$, and two different 
{hash functions}, $h<sub>1</sub>$ and $h<sub>2</sub>$.  Each {key}, $k$, is
either in $T<sub>1</sub>[h<sub>1</sub>(k)]$ or
$T<sub>2</sub>[h<sub>2</sub>(k)]$.  A new {key}, $k$, is
stored in $T<sub>1</sub>[h<sub>1</sub>(k)]$.  If that location is already
occupied by another key, $l$, the other key is moved to
$T<sub>2</sub>[h<sub>2</sub>(l)]$.  Keys are moved back and forth
until a key moves to an empty location or a limit is reached.
If the limit is reached, new hash functions are chosen, and the tables
are rehashed.  For tables that are a bit less than half full and
{universal hashing} functions, performance is good.  A key is deleted
by removing it from a table.
