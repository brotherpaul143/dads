# the comic no longer on-line: remove URL and text for it.
#
# Revision 1.3  2004/12/16 14:42:57  black
# Add Dragon Tails comic illustrating the difference between random and
# pseudorandom numbers.
#
# Revision 1.2  2004/12/15 19:31:57  black
# Remove XREF to deleted term, spectral test.  Refine XREFS into IMA,
# etc.  Add RCS keywords.  Make more XHTML compliant.

@NOTES=Any computer program is likely to generate pseudo-random
numbers, not actually random numbers.  This is important when, say,
simulations are sensitive to subtle patterns in the ``random'' numbers
or security depends on the numbers being unpredictable.
