# the definition
@DEFN=An efficient, {in-place#in-place sort} variant of {radix sort}
that distributes items into hundreds of {buckets}.  
The first step
counts the number of items in each bucket, and the second step
computes where each bucket will start in the array.  The last step
cyclically {permutes#permutation} items to their proper bucket.  Since
the buckets are in order in the array, there is no collection step.
The name comes by analogy with the {Dutch national flag} problem in
the last step: efficiently partition the array into many "stripes".
Using some efficiency techniques, it is twice as fast as
{quicksort} for large sets of strings.
