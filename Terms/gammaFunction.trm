# the definition
@DEFN=The gamma function of n, written $\Gamma(n)$, is 
$\int <sub>0</sub><sup>\infty</sup>
e<sup>-x</sup>x<sup>n-1</sup>dx$.  Recursively
$\Gamma(n+1) = n\Gamma(n)$.  For non-negative integers $\Gamma(n+1)
= {n!#factorial}$.

# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The gamma function is defined for all numbers whereas factorial
is (strictly) only defined for non-negative integers.
