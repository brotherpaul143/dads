@DEFN=Solve an {optimization problem}
by caching subproblem solutions ({memoization}) rather than
recomputing them.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN={Smith-Waterman algorithm}
Solves these problems:
{matrix-chain multiplication problem}, 
{longest common substring}, {longest common subsequence}
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={greedy algorithm}, {principle of optimality}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
