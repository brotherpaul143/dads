# Move most XREFS to VARIANT, which they are.  Add XREF to new problem:
# all simple paths

@DEFN=A list of {vertices#vertex} of a {graph} where each vertex
has an {edge} from it to the next vertex.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={simple path}, {shortest path}, {cycle}, {Hamiltonian cycle},
{Euler cycle}, {alternating path}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={all pairs shortest path}, {all simple paths}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=A path is usually assumed to be a {simple path}, unless
otherwise defined.
