@DEFN=Search a {sorted array} by estimating the next position to check
based on a linear interpolation of the search {key} and the values at
the ends of the search interval.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.

# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}

# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."

# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."

<em>Interpolation search-a log logN search</em>,
CACM 21(7):550-553, July 1978.

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=You probably use this when looking something up in the
telephone book or dictionary.  For instance, "cold fusion" is probably
near the front, so you open maybe 1/4 of the way in.  What you find there
helps you decide whether to turn many pages or just a few.  Compare
this with a {linear search}, where you check each entry in order
from the beginning, or a {binary search}, where you always divide
the search interval exactly in half.
</p>

<p>
Average run time is {O(log log n)#big-O notation} assuming the keys
are uniformly distributed.
Worst case for any distribution is O(n).
</p>

<p> 
Perl, Itai, and Avni note that "When the difference between the
indices of two successive iterations is small, it may be advantageous
to switch to sequential search ..."
Unless the data is very uniform,
there are millions of records, or comparisons are very
time-consuming, a binary search may be no slower:
interpolation is usually time-consuming on a computer and a  
binary search only takes log(n) comparisons anyway.
