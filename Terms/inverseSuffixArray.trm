@DEFN=For each position in a {string}, the inverse suffix {array} has
its index in the string's {suffix array}.  
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry

suffix array, isa, isa[i] = j iff sa[j] = i.

@NOTES=
Consider the string "good".
In {one-based indexing}, the suffix array is [4, 1, 3, 2].  The inverse
suffix array is [2, 4, 3, 1].
</p>

<p>
Many algorithms to build suffix arrays use an inverse suffix array.
A suffix array can be built from the inverse suffix array in {linear}
time.  An inverse suffix array can be turned into a suffix array in
place in linear time, too.
