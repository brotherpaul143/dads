# the definition
@DEFN=A {function} which is not defined for some inputs of the right
type, that is, for some of a {domain}.  For
instance, division is a partial function since
division by $0$ is undefined (on the Reals).

@NOTES=
This definition says a function is either partial or total, but not
both.
Some authors consider that all functions are partial, but some are
total, too.
