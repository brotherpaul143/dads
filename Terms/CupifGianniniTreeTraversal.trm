# the definition
@DEFN=Visit every {leaf} of a {perfect binary tree} with maximum
dispersion (see note).  For a tree of {height} $n$, use an $n$-bit
"count" integer. 
The least significant bit of count indicates whether to go to the left
or right {child} from the {root}. Each more significant bit indicates
whether to go left or right.  Regular binary counting generates the
list of $2<sup>n</sup>$ {paths} to the leaves.
</p>

<p>
To randomly {permute#permutation} the order of leaf visits, choose a
random $n$-bit "key" at the beginning. Use the {xor} of the key and
the count to indicate which child to visit.

# any notes.  these are not printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES="Dispersion" means the next leaf visited is as far from
other leaves visited as possible.  More formally, the next leaf has
the maximum {shortest path} to the preceding leaf (with less
importance given to be far from more distantly preceeding leaves).
</p>

<p>
It doesn't matter to the dispersion whether a 0 bit means left (and 1
means right) or 0 means right (and 0 means left).  Also the initial
value of count doesn't matter.
</p>

<p>
To picture the algorithm, consider starting with a count of 000...00,
indicating going down all left branches to the first leaf. 
The next count is 000...01, which has a shortest path distance of
$2n$: from the first leaf, go up to the root, take the right branch,
then down to the second leaf.  The next count is 000...10. This third
leaf is $2n$ from the immediately preceding leaf (the second one) and
$2n-1$ from the first leaf: up to one below the root, then down to the
first leaf.
</p>

<p>
Here is pseudocode for an inefficient Cupif-Giannini tree traversal
with Xor "randomization":
<pre>
visitNode(tree, nodeNumber, bitNumber)<br />
begin<br />
    if isLeaf(tree), then<br />
        print(tree.root);<br />
    else<br />
        if getBit(bitNumber, nodeNumber) is 1, then<br />
            visitNode(tree.left_subtree, nodeNumber, bitNumber+1);<br />
        else<br />
            visitNode(tree.right_subtree, nodeNumber, bitNumber+1);<br />
        endif<br />
    endif<br />
end<br />
<br />
cupifGiannini(tree)<br />
begin<br />
    key = random();<br />
    for n = 0 to 2**height(tree)-1<br />
        vistNode(tree, n ^ key, 1);<br />
    endfor<br />
end
</pre>
