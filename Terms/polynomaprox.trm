# the definition
@DEFN=A set of {algorithms} $\{A<sub>\epsilon</sub>| \epsilon &gt;
0\}$, where each $A<sub>\epsilon</sub>$ is a
{$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm#$\rho$-approximation
algorithm} and the execution time is bounded by a {polynomial} in the
length of the input.  The execution time may depend on the choice of
$\epsilon$.  Sometimes referred to more precisely as polynomial-time
approximation scheme.
