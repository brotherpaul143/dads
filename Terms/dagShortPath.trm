# the definition
@DEFN=Solve the {single-source shortest-path problem} in a
{weighted#weighted graph}
{directed acyclic graph} by 1) doing a {topological sort} on the
{vertices#vertex} by {edge} so vertices with no incoming {edges} are
first and vertices with only incoming {edges} are last, 2) assign an
infinite distance to every vertex ($dist(v)=\infty$) and a zero
distance to the source,
and 3) for each vertex $v$ in sorted order, for each outgoing edge
$e(v,u)$, if $dist(v) + weight(e) &lt; dist(u)$, set $dist(u)=dist(v)
+ weight(e)$ and the predecessor of $u$ to $v$.
