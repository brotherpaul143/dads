# entry name
@NAME=Bloom filter
# _A_lgorithm, _D_efinition, _P_roblem, or data _S_tructure
@TYPE=S
# basic, numeric, search, sort, graph, combin(atorial), tree, theory
@AREA=search
# the definition
@DEFN=A data structure with a {probabilistic algorithm} to quickly
test membership in a 
large set using multiple {hash functions} into a single 
{array} of bits.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN={hsadelta}
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME={array} of bits, {hash function}
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={invertible Bloom lookup table}, {locality-sensitive hashing}

# bib refs, eg, to defining article (pure HTML).  printed within <p>..</p>
@BIB=<strong>Burton Bloom</strong>, <em>Space/time trade-offs in hash
coding with allowable errors</em>, CACM, 13(7):422-426, July 1970. 
# this is right, esp. pg 422-426.  Checked in ACM Digital Library 4 May 2007

<strong>Prosenjit Bose, Hua Guo, Evangelos Kranakis, Anil Maheshwari, Pat
Morin, Jason Morrison, Michiel Smid, and Yihui Tang</strong>, <em>On
the False-Positive Rate of Bloom Filters</em>, Technical Report
TR-07-07, Carleton University - School of Computer Science, 1 March
2007.  Available at

They also conclude that "Our upper-bounds show that, for large enough
values of m with small values of k, the difference between
p<sup>k</sup> and the actual false-positive rate is negligible."

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=
A Bloom filter is good for secret sharing: giving a Bloom filter lets
someone see if you have an item (it is found in the Bloom filter), but
it is impractical to recreate the whole collection.
# implementation(s) (pure HTML)
@IMPL=
Arash Partow's
<a href="http://www.partow.net/programming/hashfunctions/">implementations
(C++, Object Pascal)</a> (go to Download, at the bottom).
# further explanation (pure HTML)
@LINKS=
The Bose, Guo, Kranakis, et. al. paper below shows that "The actual
false-positive rate is strictly larger than" Bloom's formula. <br />
{Wikipedia:Bloom filter} gives many variants and extensions.

engineering techniques</a> with links to sites with recent papers,
hash functions, etc.
<a
href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cao/papers/summary-cache/node8.html">Another
explanation</a> typo: probability of false positive is missing a
minus sign; exponent should be ... e<sup>-kn/m</sup>.
