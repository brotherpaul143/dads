<p>
Computing Fibonacci numbers with the recursive formula is an example
in the notes for {memoization}.  The $N<sup>th</sup>$ Fibonacci number
can be computed in $\log N$ steps.  The following method is by Bill Gosper
&amp; Gene Salamin, Hakmem Item 12, M.I.T.
</p>

<p>
Let pair-wise multiplication be
<pre>
	(A,B)(C,D) = (AC+AD+BC,AC+BD)
</pre>
This is just $(AX+B)*(CX+D) \bmod X<sup>2</sup>-X-1$, and so is
associative and commutative. 
Note that (A,B)(1,0) = (A+B,A) which is the Fibonacci recurrence.  Thus,
<pre>
	(1,0)^N = (F(N),F(N-1))
</pre>
which can be computed in $\log N$ steps by {repeated squaring}.
</p>

<p>
As an example, here is a table of pair-wise Fibonacci numbers:
<pre>
		       b^pow   pow	<br />
		       (1,0)	1	<br />
	 (1,0)(1,0) =  (1,1)	2	<br />
	 (1,1)(1,0) =  (2,1)	3	<br />
	 (2,1)(1,0) =  (3,2)	4	<br />
	 (3,2)(1,0) =  (5,3)	5	<br />
	 (5,3)(1,0) =  (8,5)	6	<br />
	 (8,5)(1,0) = (13,8)	7	<br />
	(13,8)(1,0) = (21,13)	8
</pre>
and here are some "Fibonacci" multiplications
<pre>
	(1,1)(1,1) = (3,2)			b^2 * b^2 = b^4	<br />
	(3,2)(3,2) = (9+6+6,9+4) = (21,13)	b^4 * b^4 = b^8	<br />
	(1,1)(5,3) = (5+3+5,5+3) = (13,8)	b^2 * b^5 = b^7	<br />
</pre>
</p>

<p>
They also note that for general second order recurrences
<pre>
	G(N+1) = XG(N) + YG(N-1)
</pre>
we have the rule
<pre>
	(A,B)(C,D) = (AD+BC+XAC,BD+YAC)
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Inverses and fractional powers are given also.
