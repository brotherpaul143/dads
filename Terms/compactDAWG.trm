@DEFN=A {directed acyclic#directed acyclic graph} word graph (DAWG)
representing the {suffixes} of a given {string} in which each {edge}
is labeled with the longest possible string.  The strings along a
{path} from the {root} to a {node} are the {substring} which the
{node} represents.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}

@NOTES=This is a variant of a directed acyclic word graph, or DAWG, in
which a {node} with one {child} is merged with its {parent} and the
edge labels are concatenated.  A Patricia tree merges single-child nodes
also, but does not combine common subtrees.
