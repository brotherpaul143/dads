@TYPE=A
# autom basic theory search sort tree graph combin numeric etc. see areas.data
@AREA=crypt
# the definition
@DEFN=Rearrange a {string} so repeated {substrings} lead to repeated
characters in the rearranged string, which is easier to compress.
Knowing which character was last in the original string, the original
can be reconstructed from the rearranged string.
