# the definition
@DEFN=A minimum-weight {tree} connecting a designated set of 
{vertices#vertex}, called <em>terminals</em>, in an 
{undirected#undirected graph}, {weighted graph} or
points in a space.
The tree may include non-terminals, which are called
{Steiner vertices#Steiner vertex} or {Steiner points}.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as name or spelling variants
@WEB=Steiner minimum tree, minimum Steiner tree

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={Euclidean Steiner tree}, {rectilinear Steiner tree}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={minimum spanning tree}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=This differs from the minimum spanning tree in that the set of
Steiner vertices must be identified.  That is, additional vertices may
be used.
