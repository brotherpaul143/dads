@DEFN=The {complexity class} of {decision problems} for which answers can be
checked for correctness, given a {certificate}, by an algorithm whose
run time is {polynomial#polynomial time} in the size of the input
(that is, it is {NP})
and no other NP problem is more than a polynomial factor harder.
Informally, a problem is NP-complete if answers can be verified
quickly, and a quick algorithm to solve this problem can be used to
solve all other NP problems quickly.

@NOTES=A trivial example of NP, but (presumably) not NP-complete is
finding the bitwise <strong>AND</strong> of two strings of $N$
boolean bits.  The problem is NP, since one can quickly 
(in time {$\Theta(N)$#\Theta}) verify that
the answer is correct, but knowing how to <strong>AND</strong> two
bit strings doesn't help one quickly find, say, a {Hamiltonian cycle} or
tour of a graph.  So bitwise <strong>AND</strong> is not
NP-complete (as far as we know).
</p>

<p>
Other well-known NP-complete problems are
satisfiability (SAT), {traveling salesman}, the {bin packing problem},
and the {knapsack problem}. (Strictly the related decision problems
are NP-complete.)
</p>

<p>
"NP" comes from the class that a {<strong>N</strong>ondeterministic
Turing machine#nondeterministic Turing machine} accepts in
<strong>P</strong>olynomial time.
