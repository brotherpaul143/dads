# the definition
@DEFN=A collection of items that are randomly accessible by a {key},
often a {string}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={array}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Implementation: the access method must essentially search for a
match.  The simplest, but slowest, implementation is to do a
{linear search} over the array for a match.
</p>

<p>
If that is too slow, and you access the array by number, too,
you must create and maintain an index into the array.  The index is a
{dictionary}, organized by the content, of indexes into the array.
