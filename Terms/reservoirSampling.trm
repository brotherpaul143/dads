@DEFN=An algorithm to randomly select $k$ items from a stream of items
of unknown length.  Save the first $k$ items in an {array} of size $k$.
For each item $j$, $j &gt; k$, choose a random integer $M$ from 1 to
$j$ (inclusive).  If $M \leq k$, replace element $M$ of the array with
item $j$.

Vitter's algorithms X, Y, and Z use far fewer random numbers by
choosing how many items to skip, rather than deciding whether or not
to skip each item.<br />

Reservoir</em>, ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS),
11(1):37-57, March 1985.<br />

# any notes.  these are not printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=
Each possible selection of $k$ items has an equal probability of
occurring.

This algorithm is an in-memory variant of Knuth's Algorithm 3.4.2R
<a href="../terms.html#Knuth97">[Knuth97, 2:144]</a>.
He credits Alan G. Waterman.  This algorithm is suggested in exercise 10.
