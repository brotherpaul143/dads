# the definition
@DEFN=A {model of computation} consisting of a set of {states}, a {start
state}, an input {alphabet}, and a {transition function} that maps
input symbols and current states to a {next state}.
Computation begins in the start state with an input string.  It
changes to new states depending on the transition function.
There are many variants, for
instance, machines having actions (outputs)
associated with transitions ({Mealy machine}) or states ({Moore machine}),
multiple start states,
transitions conditioned on no input symbol (a null) or more than one
transition for a given symbol and state ({nondeterministic finite
state machine}),
one or more states designated as {accepting states} ({recognizer}), etc.
