# the definition
@DEFN=A variant of a {threaded tree} in which only the right thread,
i.e. {link} to the successor, of each {node} is maintained.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={threaded tree}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={binary search tree}

# any notes.  these are not printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Keeping only the right thread, rather than both left and right
threads, keeps it quick to find the next greater key and faster to
insert and delete.
