@DEFN=A terribly inefficient {sort} algorithm that swaps the top and

two-thirds, then the top two-thirds, then the bottom two-thirds again.

# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={bozo sort}, {bogosort}, {lucky sort}
