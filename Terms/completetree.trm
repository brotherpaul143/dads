# Revision 1.5  2011/04/20 20:57:43  black
# Fix DEFN (just follow complete binary tree definition).  Improve WEB,
# IMA, and VARIANT references.  NOTE relation to a perfect k-ary tree.
#
# Revision 1.4  2010/12/14 13:51:03  black
# Be specific: a complete binary tree is a VARIANT
#
# Revision 1.3  2005/02/01 20:02:08  black
# Change TYPE from D to S (for ontology).
#
# Revision 1.2  2004/12/17 17:03:14  black
# Refine XREFS into IMA, etc.  Add RCS keywords.

@DEFN=A {tree} in which every level, except possibly the deepest, is
entirely filled.  At {depth} $n$, the {height} of the tree, all
{nodes} are as far left as possible.
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants

A complete tree may be viewed as a {perfect <strong>k</strong>-ary tree}
possibly with additional {leaf} nodes at depth $n+1$, all toward the
left.
