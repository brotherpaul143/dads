@DEFN=This describes a "long hand" or manual method of calculating or
extracting square roots.  Calculation of a square root by hand is a
little like long-hand division.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you need to find the square root of 66564.
Set up a "division" with the number under the radical.
Mark off pairs of digits, starting from the decimal
point and working left.  
(Here the decimal point is a period (.) and commas
(,) mark pairs of digits.)
<pre>
              ___________	<br />
            \/  6,65,64.	<br />
</pre>
Look at the leftmost digit(s) (6 in this case).  What is the largest
number whose square is less than or equal to it?  It is 2, whose
square is 4.  Write 2 above, write the square below
and subtract.
<pre>
              __2________	<br />
            \/  6,65,64.	<br />
               -4		<br />
              ----		<br />
                2		<br />
</pre>
Now bring down the next two digits (65).  The next "divisor" is double
the number on top (2x2=4) and some other digit in the units
position (4_).
<pre>
              __2________	<br />
            \/  6,65,64.	<br />
               -4		<br />
               -----		<br />
            4_ ) 265		<br />
</pre>
What is the largest number that we can put in the units and multiply
times the divisor and still be less than or equal to what we have?
(Algebraically, what is d such that $d \times 4d \leq 265$?)
It looks like 6 might work (since 6 * 40 = 240), but 6 is too
big, since 6 * 46 = 276.
<pre>
              __2__6_____	<br />
            \/  6,65,64.	<br />
               -4		<br />
               -----		<br />
            46 ) 265		<br />
                 276   TOO BIG	<br />
</pre>
So try 5 instead.
<pre>
              __2__5_____	<br />
            \/  6,65,64.	<br />
               -4		<br />
               -----		<br />
            45 ) 265		<br />
                -225		<br />
                -------		<br />
                  40		<br />
</pre>
Repeat: bring down the next two digits, and double
the number on top (2x25=50) to make a "divisor", with another
unit.
<pre>
              __2__5_____	<br />
            \/  6,65,64.	<br />
               -4		<br />
               -----		<br />
            45 ) 265		<br />
                -225		<br />
                -------		<br />
            50_ ) 4064		<br />
</pre>
It looks like 8 would work.  Let's see.
<pre>
              __2__5__8__	<br />
            \/  6,65,64.	<br />
               -4		<br />
               -----		<br />
            45 ) 265		<br />
                -225		<br />
                -------		<br />
            508 ) 4064		<br />
                 -4064		<br />
                 ------		<br />
                     0		<br />
</pre>
</p>

<p>
So the square root of 66564 is 258.  You can continue
for as many decimal places as you need: just bring
down more pairs of zeros.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example spanning the decimal point.  When a number does not
have a rational square root, you can continue calculating
(significant) digits as long as you wish.

<strong>Why does this work?</strong>
</p>

<p>
Consider $(10A + B)<sup>2</sup> = 100A<sup>2</sup> +
2 \times 10AB + B<sup>2</sup>$ and think about finding the area of a square.
Remember that 10A + B is just the numeral with B in the units place
and A in the higher position.  For 42, A=4 and B=2, so $10 \times 4 + 2 = 42$.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Images/squareRoot.gif" height="205" width="175"
alt="diagram of a square that is 10A + B on a side showing a 100A squared 
rectangle, two 10AB rectangles, and a B squared rectangle">
</p>

<p>
The area of the two skinny rectangles is 
$2 \times 10A \times B$.  The tiny square is $B<sup>2</sup>$.
If we know A and the area of the square, S, what B should we
choose?  
</p>

<p>
We previously subtracted $A<sup>2</sup>$ from S.  To scale to
$100A<sup>2</sup>$, we bring down two more digits (a factor of 100) of
the size of S.  We write down twice A (2A), but shifted one place to
leave room for B ($10 \times 2A$ or $2 \times 10A$).  Now we add B to get 
$2 \times 10A + B$.  Multiplying by B gives us $2 \times 10AB + 
B<sup>2</sup>$.  When we subtract that from the remainder (remember we
already subtracted $A<sup>2</sup>$), we have subtracted exactly
$(10A + B)<sup>2</sup>$.  That is, we have improved our knowledge
of the square root by one digit, B.
</p>
<p>
We take whatever remains, scale again by 100, by bringing down two
more digits, and repeat the process.
