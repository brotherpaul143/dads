# the definition
@DEFN=Using a fixed {dictionary}, encode words in text with strings
having many repeated characters, typically an asterisk or "star" (*).
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as name or spelling variants
@WEB=

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."

# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."

# any notes.  these are not printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=This transformation does not compress the text, but prepares it
for compression.  With many runs of stars, the encoded text may be
much more compressible than the original text.  The sender and the
receiver must communicate the dictionary somehow.
</p>

<p>
The code string for a word is the same length as the word.
Kruse and Mukherjee constructed a dictionary "from a large set
of reference texts" and assigned codes solely by frequency.
Mark Nelson built the dictionary from the input text and assigned
codes based on the word.

# implementation(s) (pure HTML)
@IMPL=
Mark Nelson's 2002 <a
href="https://marknelson.us/2002/08/01/star-encoding-in-cpp/">Star-Encoding
(C++)</a>, includes a similar algorithm that assigns shorter codes to
more frequent words.
