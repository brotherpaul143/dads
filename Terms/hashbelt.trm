@DEFN=Use a short {list} or {array} of {hash tables} to implement a
hash table with aging to expire items.  To expire items, add a new
table at the {head} of the list and drop the oldest table, along with
its contents.  To find an item, search all the tables.

This data structure may be used for a least recently used (LRU) cache:
move an item to the newest table when it is used.  Other policies may
be implemented by moving items according to other criteria.
