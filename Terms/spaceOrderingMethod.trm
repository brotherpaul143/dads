@NOTES=A concrete version of the problem is, in what order should one
visit every square in a checkerboard?  Equivalently, how should one
map a 2-dimensional array in memory?
</p>

<p>
A transversal of the mapped points in their linear order yields a
space-filling curve.

Representation</em>, ACM Computing Surveys, 36(2):159-217, June 2004.
The article describes several methods and reviews their properties:
<ul>
<li>row order (row major)
<li>row-prime order
<li>Morton order
<li>Peano-Hilbert order
<li>Cantor-diagonal order
<li>spiral order
<li>Gray order
<li>double Gray order
<li>U order
</ul>
