# Make summary of open ad. more precise and refer to chaining in general
# (instead of specifics).  Move mention of prefect hashing to "hash
# table".  Refine XREFS into IMA, etc.  Add RCS keywords.  Note that the
# overflow can be any DS.

# the definition
@DEFN=A way of handling {collisions}, that is, when two or more
items should be kept in the same location, especially in a {hash table}.
The general ways are keeping subsequent items within the table and
computing possible locations ({open addressing}), keeping {lists} for
items that collide ({chaining}), or keeping one special overflow area.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={direct chaining}, {open addressing}, {separate chaining}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN={hash table}
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS=

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The special overflow area can be any searchable data structure,
even another (smaller) hash table.
