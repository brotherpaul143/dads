@AREA=sort
# the definition
@DEFN=Pick an element from the array (the pivot), {partition} the
remaining elements into those greater than and less
than this pivot, and {recursively#recursion} sort the partitions.
There are many variants of the basic scheme above: to select the pivot,
to partition the array, to stop the recursion on small partitions, etc.
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants

@NOTES=Quicksort has running time 
{$\Theta(n<sup>2</sup>)$#\Theta} in the {worst case}, but it is typically 
{$O(n \log n)$#big-O notation}.  In practical situations, a finely
tuned implementation of quicksort beats most sort algorithms,
including sort algorithms whose theoretical complexity is 
$O(n \log n)$ in the worst case.
</p>

<p>
{Select} can be used to always pick good pivots, thus giving a
variant with {$O(n \log n)$#big-O notation} worst-case running time.

# A Killer Adversary for Quicksort
# Software-Practice and Experience 29 (1999) 341-344
# http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/mdmspe.pdf accessed 29 Sept 2003
#	A program that "watches" the choices any quicksort-like
# program makes and chooses the pessimal values, i.e., the values to
# force quadratic run time.  If the sort program only moves pointers
# and the adversary only changes values, the original input can be
# easily recovered.
#	The algorithm is called "antiquicksort"
