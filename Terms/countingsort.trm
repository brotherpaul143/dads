# Counting sort is not a simplistic radix sort - there are many subtle
# approximations.  XREF pigeonhole sort and NOTE the contrast with it.
#
# Revision 1.4  2005/04/19 19:21:16  black
# NOTE that this may be seen as a variant of radix sort.  Add Preiss IMPL.
#
# Revision 1.3  2004/12/17 14:50:16  black
# NOTE the contrast between bucket, histogram, and counting sorts.
#
# Revision 1.2  2004/12/17 14:31:53  black
# Put IMPL of Single Buffered Count Sort here from histogram sort.
# Refine XREFS into IMA, etc.  Add RCS keywords.  Make more XHTML
# compliant.

# the definition
@DEFN=A 2-pass {sort} algorithm that is efficient when the range
of {keys} is small and there many duplicate keys.  The first
pass counts the occurrences of each key in an auxiliary {array}, and
then makes a running total so each auxiliary entry is the number of
preceding keys.  The second pass puts each item in its final place
according to the auxiliary entry for that key.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}

@NOTES=A bucket sort uses fixed-size buckets.  A histogram sort
sets up buckets of exactly the right size in a first pass.  A
counting sort is a histogram sort with one bucket per possible key
value.  A pigeonhole sort is a counting sort that moves items to the
auxiliary array instead of counting them.
