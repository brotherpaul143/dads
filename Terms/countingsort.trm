# the definition
@DEFN=A 2-pass {sort} algorithm that is efficient when the range
of {keys} is small and there many duplicate keys.  The first
pass counts the occurrences of each key in an auxiliary {array}, and
then makes a running total so each auxiliary entry is the number of
preceding keys.  The second pass puts each item in its final place
according to the auxiliary entry for that key.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."

# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."

# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."

# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=A bucket sort uses fixed-size buckets.  A histogram sort
sets up buckets of exactly the right size in a first pass.  A
counting sort uses one bucket per key.
