# the definition
@DEFN=A measure of similarity between two {strings}.  The Jaro measure
is the weighted sum of percentage of matched characters from each file
and transposed characters.  Winkler increased this measure for matching
initial characters, then rescaled it by a piecewise function, whose
intervals and weights depend on the type of string (first name, last
name, street, etc.).
