@NOTES=For example, the {abstract data type} {stack} has the
operations new(), push(v, S) and popOff(S), among others.  These may
be defined with the following axioms.
<ol>
<li>new() returns a stack
<li>popOff(push(v, S)) = S
<li>top(push(v, S)) = v
</ol>
where S is a stack and v is a value.  What does this mean?  The first
axiom says all we know about new() is that it returns a stack.
Informally, we know it returns an empty stack, but "empty" is a
concept we would have to define.  So we leave it.
</p>

<p>
The second axiom says that if we push a value onto a stack then pop it
off, the result is the same stack.  The "=" can be seen as a rewrite
operation.  The axiom "X = Y" means any time we see X, we can rewrite
it to be Y.  X may contain variables representing subexpressions.
What is the meaning of "popOff(push(1776, new()))"?  The second axiom
says it means the same as new().
</p>

<p>
The third axiom assigns meaning to expressions like 
top(push(1, push(2, new()))): it is 1.  This is reasonable, since the
top element is the latest one pushed.  A series of push and popOff
operations and a top operation may be reduced with these axioms.
</p>

<p>
What stack does new() return, then?  We still haven't said; top(new())
is just not defined.  But that is how a stack works: the top of an
empty stack is not defined.  So our formalism corresponds to our
mental notion of a stack.  If we want to, we can add more axioms for
richer semantics, as is done in the {stack} entry.
