# the definition
@DEFN=A {finite state machine} with probabilities for each transition,
that is, a probability that the next state is $s<sub>j</sub>$ given
that the current state is $s<sub>i</sub>$.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."

# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."

# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."

# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={hidden Markov model}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Equivalently, a {weighted, directed graph} in which the weights
correspond to the probability of that transition.  In other words,
the weights are nonnegative and the total weight of outgoing {edges} is
positive.  If the weights are normalized, the total weight, including
{self-loops}, is 1.
