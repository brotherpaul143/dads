# the definition
@DEFN=A conceptual {algorithm} with more than one allowed step at
certain times and which always takes the right or best step.  
It is not random, as in {randomized algorithm}, or indeterminate.
Rather it has the supercomputational characteristic of choosing the
optimal behavior.

@NOTES=
Conceptually a nondeterministic algorithm could run on a deterministic
computer with an unlimited number of parallel processors.  Each time
more than one step is possible, new processes are instantly forked to
try all of them.  When one successfully finishes, that result is
returned.  Thus the computation is as fast as if it always chooses the
right step.

<P>
This notion is defined for theoretic analysis and specifying.
Nondeterministic algorithms compute the same class of functions as
{deterministic algorithms}, but the {complexity} may be much less.
Every nondeterministic algorithm can be turned into a deterministic
algorithm, possibly with {exponential} slow down.
</P>

<P>
Consider searching an unordered {array}.  A {linear search} has
{$\Theta(n)$#\Theta} expected time.  A nondeterministic search has
constant expected time.
<pre>
int search(key k, array a)		<br>
\{					<br>
    return oracleRandom(0, sizeof(a));	<br>
}
</pre>
where oracleRandom() returns (the right) number between 0 and the size
of the array in constant time.
