# Update HTML line break (br) tags to be XML/XHMTL compatible

# Change name from tree sort back to original name, treesort.

# Rename tree sort (2) since GBY uses tree sort to mean something quite
# different (and more resonable, I think).  Refine XREFS into IMA,
# etc. and fill in.  Note that these are evolutionary ancestors of the
# modern heapsort.
