# the definition
@DEFN=Given types of items of different values and volumes, find the
most valuable set of items that fit in a knapsack of fixed volume.
The number of items of each type is unbounded.  This is an {NP-hard} 
combinatorial {optimization problem}.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=There is a knapsack of capacity $c &gt; 0$ and $N$ types of
items.  Each item of type $t$ has value $v<sub>t</sub> &gt; 0$ and
weight $w<sub>t</sub> &gt; 0$.  Find the number $n<sub>t</sub> &gt; 0$
of each type of item such that they fit,
$\sum<sub>t=1</sub><sup>N</sup> n<sub>t</sub>w<sub>t</sub> \leq c$,
and the total value,
$\sum<sub>t=1</sub><sup>N</sup> n<sub>t</sub>v<sub>t</sub>$, is maximized.
