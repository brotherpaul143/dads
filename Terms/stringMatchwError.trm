# Revision "Mon Sep 30 10:27:53 2013" *by "Vreda Pieterse"
# Use {string matching} in IMPL instead of hard-coded link to DADS. 

# Revision 1.11  2011/02/28 14:12:49  black
# change DADS URL root.  Again
#
# Revision 1.10  2010/09/27 17:02:26  black
# Update DADS URLs
#
# Revision 1.9  2009/02/04 16:08:25  black
# Update DADS URL root
#
# Revision 1.8  2008/03/26 13:09:48  black
# Jaro-Winkler is a specialization, too.  Expand the reference for
# "Faster Algorithm"
#
# Revision 1.7  2005/02/02 16:33:52  black
# Correct: XREF string matching, not IMA string matching.  Note that a
# suffix tree may help.
#
# Revision 1.6  2004/12/17 17:28:47  black
# Make more XHTML compliant.
#
# Revision 1.5  2004/05/05 19:44:22  black
# Rename edit distance to be Levenshtein distance.
#
# Revision 1.4  2004/05/03 16:20:46  black
# Add web alias of string similarity search.  Add variants
# Ratcliff/Obershelp and edit distance.  Link to Faster Algorithm [for]
# String Comparison.
#
# Revision 1.3  2004/04/16 12:37:55  black
# Change phonetic matching to phonetic coding.
#
# Revision 1.2  2004/04/09 20:18:58  black
# Refine XREFS into IMA, etc.  Refer to phonetic matching.

For large collections that are searched often, it is far
faster, though more complicated, to start with an {inverted index} or
a {suffix tree}.
