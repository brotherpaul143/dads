@NOTES=This is also referred to as ``the first-digit phenomenon.''
The general significant-digit law is that the first significant digits
$ddd\ldots d$ occur with the probability
$\log<sub>10</sub>\left ( 1 + \frac\{1}\{ddd\ldots d} \right )$.
This law was first published by Simon Newcomb in 1881.  It went
unnoticed until Frank Benford, apparently unaware of Newcomb's paper,
concluded the same law and published it in 1938, supported by huge
amounts of data.
