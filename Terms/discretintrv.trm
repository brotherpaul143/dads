# entry name
@NAME=discrete interval encoding tree
# _A_lgorithm, _D_efinition, _P_roblem, or data _S_tructure
@TYPE=S
# basic, numeric, search, sort, graph, combin(atorial), tree, theory
@AREA=tree
# the definition
@DEFN=A {binary search tree} that stores consecutive values as
intervals.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=diet
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={binary search tree}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS=

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Each {node} is an interval signifying consecutive values,
instead of a single value.  This saves space and time if there are
many sets
of consecutive values.
