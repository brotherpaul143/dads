# the definition
@DEFN={Merge} $n$ sorted streams into one output stream.
All the stream heads are compared, and the head with the least {key}
is removed and written to the output.
This is repeated until all streams are empty.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={ideal merge}, {optimal merge}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The run time is {$\Theta$}(mn),
where $m$ is
the total number of elements and $n$ is the number of streams.
