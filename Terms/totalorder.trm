# the definition
@DEFN=An order defined for all pairs of items of a set.  For instance,
$\leq$ (less than or equal to) is a total order on integers, that is,
for any two integers, one of them is less than or equal to the other.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=A total order is a {relation} that is {reflexive}, {transitive},
{antisymmetric}, and total.
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.

@NOTES=
Subset ($\subseteq$) is partial not total, since \{a} is not a subset
of \{b}, nor is \{b} a subset of \{a}.  The sets \{a} and \{b} are
incomparable.

How could an order be total, but not transitive?  If it is cyclic,
