# the definition
@DEFN=A {connected graph} that is not broken into disconnected pieces
by deleting any single {vertex} (and incident {edges}).

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}

@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={cut vertex}, {biconnected component},

{triconnected graph}, {k-connected graph}
# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Informally, there are at least two independent
