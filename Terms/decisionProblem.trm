# the definition
@DEFN=A problem with a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer.  Equivalently, a
{function} whose {range} is two values, such as $\{0,1\}$.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={optimization problem}, {certificate}, {NP}, {NP-complete}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=
A decision problem asks, is there a solution with a certain
characteristic?  An optimization problem asks, what is the best
solution?  For instance, the {traveling salesman} problem is an
optimization problem, while the corresponding decision problem asks if
there is a {Hamiltonian cycle} with a cost less than some fixed amount
$k$.
