@DEFN=Search a {sorted array} by estimating the next position to check
based on the values at the two previous positions checked.

@NOTES=It is called ``secant search'' because it uses the secant of
the function at two successive points to approximate the derivative in
the Newton-Raphson formula.

<p>
To find a {key} k in an array v with indexes from 0 to $n-1$, begin
with $x<sub>0</sub> = 0$, $x<sub>1</sub> = n-1$, and $i = 1$.
Compute the next position with
<br />
$x<sub>i+1</sub> = x<sub>i</sub> - (v[x<sub>i</sub>]-k) * 
(x<sub>i</sub> - x<sub>i-1</sub>)/(v[x<sub>i</sub>] - v[x<sub>i-1</sub>])$.
<br />
If this lies outside the range, a different method (e.g., midpoint of
the range) must be used to get the next position.
</p>

<p>
Although the theoretical execution time is better than {interpolation
search} or {binary search}, coding is tricky, and the gains from
faster convergence are offset by higher costs per iteration.
