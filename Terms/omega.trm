# the definition
@DEFN=A theoretical measure of the execution of an {algorithm},
usually the time or memory needed, given the problem size $n$,
which is usually the number of items.  Informally, saying some equation
$f(n) = \omega (g(n))$ means $g(n)$ becomes insignificant relative to
$f(n)$ as $n$ goes to infinity.  
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
$f(n) = \omega (g(n))$
means that for any
positive constant $c$, 
there exists a constant $k$, such that 
$0 \leq cg(n) &lt; f(n)$ for all 
$n \geq k$.
The value of $k$ must not depend on $n$, but may depend on $c$.
