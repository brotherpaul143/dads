# entry name
@NAME=Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm

@TYPE=A

@AREA=search
# the definition
@DEFN=A {string matching} algorithm that turns the search string into
a {finite state machine}, then runs the machine with the string to be
searched as the input string.  Execution time is {O(m+n)#big-O
notation}, where m is the length of the search string, and n is the
length of the string to be searched.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=KMP
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=Knuth-Pratt-Morris algorithm, KPM

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."

# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
