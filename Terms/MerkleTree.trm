# the definition
@DEFN=A {tree} (usually a {binary tree}) in which each {internal node}
has a {hash#hash function} of all the information in the {leaf} nodes
under it.  Specifically, each internal node has a hash of the
information in its {children#child}.  Each leaf has a hash of the
block of information it represents.  All leaf nodes are at the same
{depth}.  All nodes are as far left as possible.
</p>

<p>
To add a block (leaf) to a {full#full binary tree} tree, a new {root}
is created with the old root as its left child.  Its right child is a
degenerate tree reaching all the way to the leaf level.

# any notes.  these are not printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Usually the branching is two, making it a {binary tree}, but it
can be a {k-ary tree}.
</p>

<p>
Given two copies of possibly-the-same information represented by
Merkle trees, one can check whether the copies are the same by
just comparing the hashes at the root.  A single difference between
the copies can be found by just comparing the hashes at interior nodes
on a path to the different leaf.  This is logarithmic in the number of
leaves.
</p>

<p>
A {complete tree} has all nodes as far left as possible, too, but
every level is filled.
