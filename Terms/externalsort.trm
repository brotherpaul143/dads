# the definition
@DEFN=Any {sort} algorithm that uses external memory, such as tape
or disk, during the sort.  Since most common sort algorithms assume
high-speed random access to all intermediate memory, they are
unsuitable if the values to be sorted don't fit in main memory.

@NOTES=Algorithms may read the initial values from magnetic tape or
write sorted values to disk, but this is not using external memory
during the sort.  Note that even though virtual memory may mask the
use of disk, sorting sets of data much larger than main memory may be
much faster using an explicit external sort.
