# Historical note 
@HISTORY=
K. Mei-Ko's article referred to optimizing a postman's route, was
written by a Chinese author, and appeared in a Chinese math journal.  
Based on this Alan J. Goldman suggested the name "Chinese Postman
problem" to Jack Edmonds when Edmonds was in Goldman's Operations
Research group at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (now NIST).
Edmonds appreciated its "catchiness" and adopted it.  
Goldman was also indirectly influenced by recalling an Ellery
Queen mystery named "The Chinese Orange Mystery".
(Alan J. Goldman, personal communication, 14 December 2003)

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=
This is similar to finding the most efficient way to route garbage
trucks, school buses, etc.  A good algorithm is given in
<strong>Jack Edmonds</strong> and <strong>Ellis L. Johnson</strong>, 
<em>Matching, Euler Tours, and the Chinese Postman</em>,
Mathematical Programming, 5:88-124, 1973.
