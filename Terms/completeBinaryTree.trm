@AREA=tree
# the definition
@DEFN=A {binary tree} in which every {level} (depth), except possibly the
deepest, is completely filled.  At depth $n$, the {height} of the
tree, all {nodes} must be as far left as possible.  
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=CBT

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={complete tree}, {binary tree}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={binary heap}, {perfect binary tree}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."

@NOTES=A complete binary tree has $2<sup>k</sup>$ nodes at every
{depth} $k &lt; n$ and between $2<sup>n</sup>$ and $2<sup>n+1</sup>-1$
nodes altogether.
It can be efficiently implemented as an {array}, where a node at index
$i$ has children at indexes $2i$ and $2i+1$ and a
parent at index $i/2$, with {one-based indexing}.  
If child index is greater than the number
of nodes, the child does not exist.

This kind of tree is called "complete" by authors that mention it
(Budd page 332, Ege, Carrano &amp; Prichard page 427, Goodrich &amp;
Tamassia page 302,
<a href="../terms.html#HS83">[HS83, page 226]</a>,
<a href="../terms.html#Knuth97">[Knuth97]</a>,
<a href="../terms.html#Stand98">[Stand98, page 249]</a>).  Some
authors call {perfect binary trees} "complete".
