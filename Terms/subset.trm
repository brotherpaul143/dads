@DEFN=A {set} S<sub>1</sub> is a subset of another set
S<sub>2</sub> if every
element in S<sub>1</sub> is in S<sub>2</sub>.  S<sub>2</sub> may
have exactly the same elements as S<sub>1</sub>.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=$S<sub>1</sub> \subseteq S<sub>2</sub>$ iff
$\forall s, s \in S<sub>1</sub> \rightarrow s \in S<sub>2</sub>$.
