# the definition
@DEFN=A {set} S<sub>1</sub> is a subset of another set
S<sub>2</sub> if every
element in S<sub>1</sub> is in S<sub>2</sub>.  S<sub>2</sub> may
have exactly the same elements as S<sub>1</sub>.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=$S<sub>1</sub> \subseteq S<sub>2</sub>$ iff
$\forall s, s \in S<sub>1</sub> \rightarrow s \in S<sub>2</sub>$.
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}

@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."

@NOTES=If S<sub>1</sub> is a subset of S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>2</sub> is
a superset of S<sub>1</sub>.
<p>
A combination is a subset with exactly $n$ elements.
