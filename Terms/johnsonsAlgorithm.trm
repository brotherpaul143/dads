# the definition
@DEFN=An algorithm to solve the {all pairs shortest path} problem in a
{sparse#sparse graph} {weighted, directed graph}.  First, it adds a
new {node} with zero weight
edges from it to all other nodes, and runs the {Bellman-Ford
algorithm} to check for negative weight {cycles} and find $h(v)$, the
least weight of a path from the new node to node $v$.  Next it
reweights the edges using the nodes' $h(v)$ values.  Finally for each
node, it runs {Dijkstra's algorithm} and stores the computed least
weight to other nodes, reweighted using the nodes' $h(v)$ values, as
the final weight.
The time complexity is {$O(V<sup>2</sup>\log V + VE)$#big-O notation}.
