# the definition
@DEFN=A {balanced#balanced tree} {search tree} in which every {node}
has between
$\lceil m/2\rceil$ and $m$ {children#child}, where $m&gt;1$ is a fixed
integer.  $m$ is the {order}.  The {root} may have as few as 2 children.
This is a good structure if much of the tree is in slow memory (disk),
since the {height}, and hence the number of accesses, can be kept small,
say one or two, by picking a large $m$.

The origin of "B-tree" has never been explained by the
authors. ... "balanced," "broad," or "bushy" might apply.  Others
suggest that the "B" stands for Boeing. [Bayer and McCreight were at
Boeing Scientific Research Labs in 1972.] Because of his
contributions, however, it seems appropriate to think of B-trees as
"Bayer"-trees.
