# Refine def'n to distinguish better from primary clustering.  Change
# file name.

# Refine XREFS into IMA, etc.  Add RCS keywords.

# the definition
@DEFN=The tendency for some {collision resolution schemes} to create
long run of filled slots away from a {key} {hash#hash function}
position, e.g., along the {probe sequence}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={primary clustering}, {clustering free}, {hash table}, {open
addressing}, {clustering}, {linear probing}, {quadratic probing},
{double hashing}, {uniform hashing}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Secondary clustering increases average search time.  Even
{quadratic probing} is susceptible to secondary clustering since
{keys} that have
the same hash value also have the same probe sequence.
{Clustering} may be minimized with {double hashing}.
