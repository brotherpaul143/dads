c$.

@NOTES=The relation ``less than'' is transitive: if $a &lt; b$ and $b
&lt; c$, then $a &lt; c$.  The relation ``is an ancestor of'' is also
transitive: if Reuben is an ancestor of Bill and Bill is an ancestor
of Patrick, Reuben is an ancestor of Patrick.  However ``likes'' is
not transitive since someone I like may like someone that I don't
like.
