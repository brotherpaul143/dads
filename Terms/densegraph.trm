# Use the standard English plural of vertex

# Revision 1.6  2004/03/09 17:00:55  black
# Put curly braces around vertices.
#
# Revision 1.5  2004/03/09 16:56:41  black
# Move the number of edges to NOTE since directed and undirected graphs
# have different numbers of edges.  Also note there is no strict
# distinction between sparse and dense graphs.

# Revision 1.4  2003/12/29 17:19:22  black
# Move Preiss link and commentary from LINKS to NOTES because LINKS
# doesn't convert Latex math expressions ($...$)
#
# Revision 1.3  2003/12/27 16:51:55  black
# Refer to Preiss' definition of sparse and dense graphs.
# Drop the requirement in the definition that a dense graph is undirected.
# Refine XREF to IMA, VARIANT, IMIN, etc.
#
# Revision 1.2  2003/10/16 17:02:17  black
# Use a more regular plural of vertex

@DEFN=A {graph} in which the number of {edges} is close to
the possible number of edges.

# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={graph}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."

@NOTES=
A {directed graph} can have at most $n(n-1)$ edges, where $n$ is the
number of {vertices#vertex}.
An {undirected graph} can have at most $n(n-1)/2$ edges.

There is no strict distinction between sparse and dense graphs.
Bruno Preiss' <a
href="http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus4/html/page534.html">definition
of sparse and dense graphs</a> has problems, but may help.  First, for
one graph, one can always choose a k.  Second a class of graphs might
be considered sparse if $|E| = O(|V|<sup>k</sup>)$ and $2 &gt; k &gt; 1$.
$|E|$ is the number of edges, and $|V|$ is the number of vertices.
