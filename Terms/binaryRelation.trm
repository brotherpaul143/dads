# the definition
@DEFN=A {relation} between exactly two items at a time, such
as "greater than" ($&gt;$), "not equal to" ($\neq$), "proper subset
of" ($\subset$), or "is connected to" (has an {edge} to) for
{vertices#vertex} of a {graph}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={relation}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={dictionary}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={binary function}, {reflexive}, {symmetric}, {transitive},
{antisymmetric}, {irreflexive}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=One may think of a binary relation as a binary function whose
{range} is $\{true, false}$.  For example since $3 &gt; 2$,
$GreaterThan(3, 2) = true$.
