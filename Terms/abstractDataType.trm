@NOTES=Since the data values and operations are defined with
mathematical precision, rather than as
an implementation in a computer language, we may reason about effects
of the operations, relations to other abstract data types, whether a
program implements the data type, etc.
</p>

<p>
One of the simplest abstract data types is the {stack}.  
The operations new(), push(v, S), top(S), and popOff(S) may be
defined with {axiomatic semantics} as following.
<ol>
<li>new() returns a stack
<li>popOff(push(v, S)) = S
<li>top(push(v, S)) = v
</ol>
where S is a stack and v is a value.  (The usual pop operation is a
combination of top, to return the top value, and popOff, to remove the
top value.)
Contrast this with the {axiomatic semantics} definition of a {set}, a
{dictionary}, or a {queue}.
</p>

<p>
From these axioms, one may define
equality between stacks, define a pop function which returns the top
value in a non-empty stack, etc.  For instance, the {predicate}
isEmpty(S) may be 
added and defined with the following additional axioms.
<ol start="4">
<li>isEmpty(new()) = true
<li>isEmpty(push(v, S)) = false
</ol>
</p>
