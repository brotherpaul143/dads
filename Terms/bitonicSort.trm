# Mon Feb 10 09:06:55 2020  Paul E. Black
# Update URL of Lang IMPL.
# 
# Tue Mar 25 10:48:30 2014  Paul E. Black
# Dont refer to sample IMPL as "reference" - it may cause confusion.
# Add a sentence suggesting the parallel nature of the algorithm.
# 
# Revision 1.12  2012/12/31 14:10:34  black
# Remove Portable Parallel C++ implementation. It is gone, and the
# prof. in charge is listed as emeritus. I don't think the site is
# coming back.
#
# Revision 1.11  2009/09/04 15:47:50  black
# cite Knuth with V:PP (volume number, colon, page number)
#
# Revision 1.10  2009/09/04 14:48:05  black
# refer to algorithm "name" in Knuth with section context, as he does.
#
# Revision 1.9  2009/08/24 14:19:35  black
# update URL for C (and Java) IMPL
#
# Revision 1.8  2008/08/14 16:13:53  black
# Update HTML line break (br) tags to be XML/XHMTL compatible
#
# Revision 1.7  2007/01/10 15:55:11  black
# IMA oblivious algorithm
#
# Revision 1.6  2005/11/28 12:16:35  black
# Add pC++ IMPL.
#
# Revision 1.5  2005/09/06 16:27:54  black
# Remove csam.iit.edu/~sun/ link from NOTE - not authorized to access directory
#
# Revision 1.4  2005/01/26 21:56:37  black
# Improve definition.  Add reference for Knuth's Algo M.  Add WEB name
# of merge exchange sort.  NOTE that this is an oblivious sort, and give
# example.
#
# Revision 1.3  2005/01/04 16:08:18  black
# Remove eisenb URL - account is gone from server.

<p>
This sorts increasingly larger intermingled subsets, somewhat like
{Shell sort}, and merges subsets, like {merge sort}.
</p>

<p>
Elements are compared and swapped in a fixed (oblivious) schedule, so
this may be implemented with only conditional swaps.  Here is a
Batcher sort for four elements:
<pre>
    compareAndSwap(0, 1);<br />
    compareAndSwap(2, 3);<br />
    compareAndSwap(0, 2);<br />
    compareAndSwap(1, 3);<br />
    compareAndSwap(1, 2);
</pre>
where compareAndSwap(i,j) is if (a[i] &lt; a[j]) Swap(a[i], a[j]).
Notice that the first pair of operations, (0, 1) and (2, 3),
can be performed in parallel, as can the second pair (0, 2) and (1, 3).
