# the definition
@DEFN=A method for minimizing a {boolean expression}, usually aided by
a rectangular map of the value of the expression for all possible input
values.  Input values are arranged in a {Gray code}.  Maximal
rectangular groups that cover the inputs where the expression is true
give a minimum implementation.

In the example, "*" means "don't care", that is, it doesn't
matter what the function value is for those inputs.  This expression
may be realized as AB' + AD + BC'D + B'CD'.  Some expressions may be
implemented more compactly by grouping 
the zeros, possibly including "don't care" cells, and negating the
final output.  The positive implementation is smaller for this
expression.
