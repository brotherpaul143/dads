# the definition
@DEFN=(1) Proportional to.  (2) Asymptotically equal to.  A
theoretical measure of the execution of an {algorithm},
usually the time or memory needed, given the problem size $n$,
which is usually the number of items.  Informally, saying some equation
$f(n) \sim g(n)$
means it grows at the same rate as $g(n)$.
More formally, it means 
$lim<sub>x \rightarrow \infty</sub>f(x)/g(x) = 1$.
