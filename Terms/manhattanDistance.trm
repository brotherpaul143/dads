# the definition
@DEFN=The distance between two points measured along axes at right
angles.
In a plane with $p<sub>1</sub>$ at $(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)$ and
$p<sub>2</sub>$ at $(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)$, it is 
$|x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>| + |y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>|$.

@NOTES=
This is easily generalized to higher dimensions.  Manhattan
distance is often used in integrated circuits where wires only run
parallel to the X or Y axis.
See links at {$L<sub>m</sub>$ distance} for more detail.
</p>

<p>
Also known as {rectilinear} distance, Minkowski's $L<sub>1</sub>$
distance, taxi cab metric, or city block
distance.
</p>

<p>
{Hamming distance} can be seen as Manhattan distance between bit
vectors.
