# the definition
@DEFN=The distance between two points measured along axes at right
angles.
In a plane with $p<sub>1</sub>$ at $(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)$ and
$p<sub>2</sub>$ at $(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)$, it is 
$|x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>| + |y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>|$.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# comma-separated list of pure names
@WEB=rectilinear distance, taxi cab metric, city block norm

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={$L<sub>m</sub>$ distance}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={Euclidean distance}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=
This is easily generalized to higher dimensions.  Manhattan
distance is often used in integrated circuits where wires only run
parallel to the X or Y axis.

Also known as {rectilinear} distance, taxi cab metric, or city block
distance.

Wikipedia says this concept was considered by Hermann Minkowski in the
19th century.
