# entry name
@NAME=treesort (1)
# _A_lgorithm, _D_efinition, _P_roblem, or data _S_tructure
@TYPE=A
# basic, numeric, search, sort, graph, combin(atorial), tree, theory
@AREA=sort
# the definition
@DEFN=A {sort} algorithm that first builds a {binary search tree} of
the {keys}, then accesses the
keys with an {in-order traversal}.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as name or spelling variants
@WEB=tree sort

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={sort}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME={binary search tree}, {in-order traversal}
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={blind sort}, {treesort (2)}, {heapsort}


# bib refs, eg, to defining article (pure HTML).  printed within <p>..</p>
