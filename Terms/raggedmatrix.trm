@DEFN=A {matrix} having irregular numbers of items in each row.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."

usually not thought of as being ragged since the number of items in
each row is regular (changing by one from row to row).
