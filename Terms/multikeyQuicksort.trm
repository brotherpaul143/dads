# Revision 1.5  2005/12/30 20:16:38  black
# fix typo in BIB entry
#
# Revision 1.4  2005/12/14 19:01:00  black
# This uses a kind of postman's sort, not a radix sort.
#
# Revision 1.3  2005/12/14 16:14:24  black
# Change name to multikey Quicksort, the authors' term.  Add DEFN, IMA
# quicksort, and Dutch national flag problem is INME.  Fix SIAM BIB
# entry, and remove Dr. Dobbs BIB: it is not generally accessible.  NOTE
# that it is good for strings and has a good 3-way partition algorithm.
#
# Revision 1.2  2004/12/17 16:55:07  black
# Refine XREFS into IMA, etc.  Add RCS keywords.  Make more XHTML compliant.

@DEFN=Pick an element from the array (the pivot).  Consider the first
character (key) of the {string} (multikey).  {Partition} the
remaining elements into three sets: those whose corresponding
character is less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot's
character.  {Recursively#recursion} sort the "less than" and
"greater than" partitions on the same character.
Recursively sort the "equal to" partition by the next character
(key).
