# the definition
@DEFN=The number of nodes in a {quadtree} region representation for a simple polygon (i.e. with nonintersecting edges and without holes) is $O(p+q)$ for a $2<sup>q</sup>\times 2<sup>q</sup>$ image with perimeter $p$ measured in pixel widths.  In most cases, $q$ is negligible, and thus, the number of nodes is proportional to the perimeter.  It also holds for three-dimensional data where the perimeter is replaced by surface area, and in general  for $d$-dimensions where instead of perimeter we have the size of the $(d-1)$-dimensional interfaces between the $d$-dimensional objects.
