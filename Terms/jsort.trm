@AREA=sort
# the definition
@DEFN=An {in-place sort} algorithm that uses {strand sort} to sort
fewer than about 40 items and {shuffle sort} to sort more.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=j sort

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={in-place sort}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME={strand sort}, {shuffle sort}
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={sort}, {JSort}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Called "quick-er sort" by one Th&eacute;odore Myshrall in an
apparent plagiarism for a 1998 school project.
# The report, written in French, gives the algorithm in pseudo-code.
# But the pseudo-code is in English and is an exact copy of the
# pseudo-code in the John Cohen note!
# further explanation (pure HTML)
@LINKS=John Cohen says in a
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fido7.ru.algorithms/msg/26084cdb04008ab3">message
posted in 1997</a> that he invented this algorithm.
