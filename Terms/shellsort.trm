@NOTES=
{Comb sort} does a single "bubbling" pass (ala {bubble sort}) over
each set for each gap or increment, whereas Shell sort completely
sorts each set.
</p>

<p>
Donald E. Knuth extensively analyzes this algorithm in 
<a href="../terms.html#Knuth98">[Knuth98, vol. 3, Sect. 5.2.1]</a>. 
A good set of increments is 2<sup>k</sup>+1, . . ., 9, 5, 3, 1 with
the first increment no more than $N/3$.

# any historical notes
@HISTORY=
# Based on an "adaptation by Marlene Metzner"
This algorithm was improperly called the Shell-Metzner sort by
<strong>John P. Grillo</strong>, <em>A Comparison of Sorts</em>,
Creative Computing, 2:76-80, Nov/Dec 1976.
# Copy of "A Comparison of Sorts" in Mnemo 5
</p>

<p>
Grillo cites <strong>Fredric Stuart</strong>, <em>FORTRAN
Programming</em>, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1969, page 294.
In crediting "one of the fastest" programs for sorting, Stuart says
in a footnote, "Published by Marlene Metzner, Pratt &amp; Whitney
Aircraft Company.  From a method described by D. L. Shell."

I had nothing to do with the sort, and my name should never have been
attached to it.
</p>

<p>
So, here's the scoop. 
</p>

<p>
I graduated from college in 1956 with a degree in Math.  The math I
took for a college degree in 1956 is pretty
much all taught in high school now.  I applied for a job at GE in
Evendale, Cincinnati.  (It was that or teach high school.)  They put
me to work programming an IBM 704 in an assembly language called CAGE.
I don't remember what it stood for, but the GE was General
Electric. Probably "Computer Assembler by General Electric".  Don
Shell worked in the same building, but he was manager of the Systems
Analysts.  I was one of the many who got several pages of equations
and turned them into code that would run via punched cards.  This was
before Basic and Fortran.  The Systems Analysts wrote assemblers, ways
to create buffers to make printing faster, etc.  I doubt that Don
Shell even knew I who I was.  About 1959 we started using Fortran --
just a little.
</p>

<p>
I think Don Shell wrote up the theory of his sorting method for the
Computing Dept. newsletter.  I thought it was interesting and held on
to a copy.
</p>

<p>
In 1960, I bought a convertible and moved to Florida.  Why?  I was
young, single, the field was wide open and Florida sounded like fun.
Accepted a job at Pratt &amp; Whitney in West Palm Beach.  Did the same
kind of programming, but Pratt had a brand new IBM 7090.  They
programmed in SAP. 
# Don't remember what that stands for, either.  
It
was similar to CAGE.  The logic was the same, but the instruction names
differed just enough to be confusing. 
</p>

<p>
Somewhere around 1961 or so, Pratt got an 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1620">IBM 1620</a>. 
This was a much smaller computer using punched paper tape instead of
cards.  
# Did it's math by using tables loaded during boot. (CADET -- Can't
# Add, Doesn't Even Try).  
Colleges used it for teaching computers.  Pratt
used it in the Engineering Dept. so engineers could handle smaller
problems on their own instead of bringing them to the Computer Lab.  
I was put in charge of co-ordinating the 1620 in Engineering with the
Computer Dept.  IBM started a 1620 USER's group.  I was sent to the
first meeting.  Being the only woman there, I was naturally voted in
as Secretary-Treasurer.  Within the first year, a company in Germany
bought one so now it was the IBM 1620 INTERNATIONAL USER'S GROUP. 
</p>

<p>
The User's Group put out a Newsletter.  People wrote in with
questions, suggestions, ideas, etc.  To help fill up one of the
earlier editions, I pulled out Don Shell's sort method and coded it in
Fortran.  Took about 10 lines of code, give or take five, and an equal
amount of time.  Gave Don Shell complete credit.
</p>

<p>
In 1963 I got married.  In 1964 I left P &amp; W to start a family.
Taught the 1620 and the IBM 1401 at Palm Beach Junior College (now
Palm Beach Community College) for a couple of years, but had no contact
with P &amp; W 
or the User's Group.
</p>

<p>
 Now I find someone who read it started calling it Shell-Metzner.
It's a wonder Don Shell didn't hunt me down and sue!
</p>

#I kept that copy of the newsletter for many years.  I'm searching.
#We moved to a log cabin in the woods about three years ago and a lot
#of "memories" had to be dumped.  I don't think I would have thrown
#that away.  If I find it, I'll e-mail you a copy.  I'll be glad to
#answer any questions you might have.

to the idea that Mom was once "smart" was worth the potential law
suit.
