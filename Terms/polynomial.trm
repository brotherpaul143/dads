# the definition
@DEFN=(1) Any function which is the sum of constants times powers of
the argument:
$f(x)=\Sigma<sub>i=0</sub><sup>k</sup> c<sub>i</sub>x<sup>p<sub>i</sub></sup>$.
(2) In complexity theory, the measure of computation, $m(n)$ (usually
execution time or memory space), is bounded by a polynomial function
of the problem size, $n$.  More
formally $m(n) = {O(n<sup>k</sup>)#big-O notation}$.

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Strictly speaking, a linear function is a polynomial with the
highest exponent being 1, and a logarithmic function is a polynomial
with fractional exponents.  However polynomial usually means exponents
greater than 1.
