# the definition
@DEFN=An extension of a {finite state machine} that
operates on n-ary constructors.  Where a finite state automaton reaches
a new state with a single state and character, a tree automaton
takes <em>n</em> states and constructors.  Tree automata may be
top-down (starting from the {root}) or bottom-up (starting from the
{leaves#leaf}), and {deterministic} or {nondeterministic}.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={deterministic finite tree automaton},
{nondeterministic finite tree automaton}, {deterministic tree automaton},
{nondeterministic tree automaton}, {top-down tree automaton}
# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Words for finite state automata can be seen as composed of
unary constructors, the {alphabet}, and a 0-ary constructor, the
end of the word.

<p>
Nondeterministic top-down and bottom-up automata, and
deterministic bottom-up automata are equivalent, but top-down automata
are weaker.
