# the definition
@DEFN=A {merge sort} that sorts a data stream using repeated
merges.  It distributes the input into $k$ streams by
repeatedly reading a
{block} of input that fits in memory, called a <em>run</em>, sorting it, then
writing it to the next stream.  It then repeatedly merges
the $k$ streams and puts each merged run into one of $j$
output streams until there is a single sorted output.
