@DEFN=A polynomial $A(x) = a<sub>0</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>x +
a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup> + a<sub>3</sub>x<sup>3</sup> + \ldots$ may
be written as $A(x) = a<sub>0</sub> + x(a<sub>1</sub> +
x(a<sub>2</sub> + x(a<sub>3</sub> + \ldots)))$.

@NOTES=A polynomial may be evaluated at a point $x'$, that is $A(x')$
computed, in {$\Theta(n)$#$\Theta$} time using Horner's rule.  That
is, repeated multiplications and additions, rather than the naive
methods of raising $x$ to powers, multiplying by the coefficient, and
accumulating.
