# the definition
@DEFN=Find an element in an {array}.  Various algorithms exist which
require more or less structure in the array elements or
implementation.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={linear search}, {binary search}, {interpolation search},

{string matching}
# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=An {external index}, such as a {hash table} or {inverted index} may
help make the search quicker and speed overall processing if
the array is not changed often.
