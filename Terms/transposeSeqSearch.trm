@AREA=search
# the definition
@DEFN=Search an {array} or {list} by checking items one at a
time.  If the value is found, swap it with its predecessor so it is
found faster next time.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=self-organizing sequential search
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={linear search}, {move-to-front heuristic}, {self-organizing list}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=
This moves more frequently searched items to the front.  If
a few items are sought much more often than the rest, this can save
time.  A {binary search} or {hash table} is almost always
faster, though.
