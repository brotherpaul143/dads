# the definition
@DEFN=(1) A {directed acyclic graph} representing the {suffixes} of a
given {string} in which each {edge} is labeled with a character.  The
characters along a {path} from the {root} to a {node} are the
{substring} which the {node} represents.
(2) A {finite state machine} that recognizes a set of words.

@NOTES=
A variant, the compact DAWG, labels the edges with strings, not just
single characters.  In the compact DAWG, any {node} with one {child}
is merged with its {parent} and the edge labels are concatenated.
Another variant is the morphic DAWG, where some substrings are
coded with new characters, like a simplified {Huffman coding}.
