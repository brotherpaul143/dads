# the definition
@DEFN=For two elements $e<sub>i</sub>$ and $e<sub>j</sub>$, the locus of points equidistant from $e<sub>i</sub>$ and $e<sub>j</sub>$.  That is $\{p|d(p,e<sub>i</sub>)=d(p(e<sub>j</sub>)}$, where $d$ is some distance metric.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS=

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=For instance, if $e<sub>i</sub>$ and $e<sub>j</sub>$ are two
points in the plane and we use {Euclidean distance}, the bisector is
the perpendicular bisector of the line segment
$\overline\{e<sub>i</sub>,e<sub>j</sub>}$.
