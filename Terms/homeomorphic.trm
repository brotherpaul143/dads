# entry name
@NAME=homeomorphic
# _A_lgorithm, algo _T_echnique, _D_efinition, _P_roblem, or data _S_tructure
@TYPE=D
# autom basic theory search sort tree graph combin numeric etc. see areas.data
@AREA=graph
# the definition
@DEFN=Two {graphs} are homeomorphic if they can be made
{isomorphic} by inserting new {vertices#vertex} of {degree} 2 into
{edges}.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names or {cross refs} that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS=

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=This corresponds to the topological notion since adding or
removing degree 2 vertices doesn't change the graph's topology.

This is similar to, but not the same as, homomorphic.
