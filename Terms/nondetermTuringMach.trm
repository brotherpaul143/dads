# the definition
@DEFN=A {Turing machine} which has more than one {next state} for some combinations of contents of the current cell and current state.  An input is accepted if any move sequence leads to acceptance.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={alternating Turing machine}, {oracle Turing machine}, {probabilistic Turing machine}, {universal Turing machine}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=
A nondeterministic Turing machine is a {probabilistic Turing machine}
ignoring the probabilities.
