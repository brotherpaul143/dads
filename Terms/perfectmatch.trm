# the definition
@DEFN=A {matching}, or subset of {edges} without common
{vertexes}, of a {connected graph} that touch
all vertexes exactly once.  A graph with an odd number of vertexes is
allowed one unmatched vertex.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=
# comma-sep list of pure names or {cross refs} that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=perfect match

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA=
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={bipartite matching}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN={Christofides algorithm}
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS=

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The term comes from matching each vertex with exactly one
other vertex.

<P>
Any perfect matching of a graph with $n$ vertexes has n/2 edges.
</P>

<P>
If a graph has a {Hamiltonian cycle}, it has two different perfect
matchings, since the edges in the cycle could be alternately colored.
