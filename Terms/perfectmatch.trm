# the definition
@DEFN=A {matching}, or subset of {edges} without common
{vertices#vertex}, of a {connected graph} that touches
all vertices exactly once.  A graph with an odd number of vertices is
allowed one unmatched vertex.

@NOTES=The term comes from matching each vertex with exactly one
other vertex.

<p>
Any perfect matching of a graph with $n$ vertices has n/2 edges.
</p>

<p>
If a graph has a {Hamiltonian cycle}, it has two different perfect
matchings, since the edges in the cycle could be alternately colored.
