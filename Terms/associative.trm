@NOTES=Multiplication is associative, e.g., $2 \times (3 \times 4) = 
(2 \times 3) \times 4$, and commutative, e.g., $2 \times 3 = 3 \times 2$.
Subtraction is neither associative, e.g., $2 - (3 - 4) \neq
(2 - 3) - 4$, nor commutative, e.g., $2 - 3 \neq 3 - 2$.  Because of
rounding floating point addition on a computer is not associative,
e.g., $(1000000 + .00001) + .00001 \neq 1000000 + (.00001 + .00001)$
(actual values depend on the details of the computer addition), but is
commutative, e.g., $1000000 + .00001 = .00001 + 1000000$.  <br />
Cartesian product is associative, e.g., $\{1, 2} \times
(\{a, b} \times \{X, Y}) = (\{1, 2} \times \{a, b}) \times
\{X, Y}$, but is not commutative, e.g., $\{1, 2} \times \{a, b} \neq
\{a, b} \times \{1, 2}$.
