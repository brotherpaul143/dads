# the definition
@DEFN=A {balanced k-way merge sort} that sorts a data stream using
repeated merges.  It distributes the input into two streams by
repeatedly reading a
{block} of input that fits in memory, a <em>run</em>, sorting it, then
writing it to the next stream.  It then repeatedly merges
the two streams and puts each merged run into one of two
output streams until there is a single sorted output.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={external sort}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={merge sort}, {simple merge},
{balanced merge sort}, {nonbalanced merge sort}, 
{two-way merge sort}
