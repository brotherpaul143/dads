# Revision 1.8  2006/09/11 14:03:52  black
# Update tutorial IMPL URL
#
# Revision 1.7  2004/09/22 12:57:34  black
# Correct spelling of Fibonacci
#
# Revision 1.6  2004/04/06 18:46:49  black
# Add that IMIN heapsort and priority queue.  Add bib reference.
#
# Revision 1.5  2004/02/19 18:08:56  black
# Add Fib heap as a variant.
#
# Revision 1.4  2004/01/07 18:16:32  black
# Correct definition: a heap is a complete tree (a binary heap is a
# complete binary tree).  Move most of the xrefs, notes, implementation
# links, etc. to binary heap, since most of them apply to binary heaps.
# Refine XREFS into IMA, IMIN, etc.  Add a note about OS heaps.
#
# Revision 1.3  2003/09/05 14:35:08  black
# Note that a heap may be efficiently implemented as an array - copy the
# note from complete binary tree.
#
# Revision 1.2  2003/09/05 14:25:13  black
# Be more specific - a heap is a complete binary tree.

# the definition
@DEFN=A {complete tree} where every {node} has a {key} more
extreme (greater or less) than or equal to the key of its {parent}.
Usually understood to be a {binary heap}.

@BIB=<strong>J. W. J. Williams</strong>, <em>Algorithm 232 Heapsort</em>,
CACM, 7(6):378-348, June 1964.
# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Speaking about operating systems, "heap" refers to
memory from which chunks can be allocated.
