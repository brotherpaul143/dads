# the definition
@DEFN=(1) Any function that is a constant times the logarithm
of the argument: $f(x)=c \log x$.
(2) In complexity theory, when the measure of computation, $m(n)$ (usually
execution time or memory space), is bounded by a logarithmic function
of the problem size, $n$.  More
formally $m(n) = {O(\log n)#big-O notation}$.
(3) Sometimes imprecisely used to mean {polylogarithmic}.
