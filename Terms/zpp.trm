# the definition
@DEFN=The class of {languages} for which a membership computation
by a {probabilistic Turing machine} halts in {polynomial time} with no
false acceptances or rejections, but randomly some "I don't know" answers.
"ZPP" means "<strong>Z</strong>ero error <strong>P</strong>robability
in <strong>P</strong>olynomial" time.
# formal definition or {cross reference} to an entry
@FORML=For a language, S, there exists a {probabilistic Turing
machine}, M, that halts in {polynomial time}.  M (correctly) accepts
or rejects the string or, randomly, halts in an "I don't know" state.
# comma-sep list of pure names that this is Also Known As.
@AKA=
# other cross-listings solely for the web, such as word or spelling variants
@WEB=zero error probability in polynomial time

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}

# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."

@NOTES=By repeating the run, the correct answer will always be found,
albeit with polynomial expected run time.
