 Figure by Joshua O'Madadhain <jmadden@ics.uci.edu> 6 October 2005.

"I've attached a similar diagram which uses color to indicate root and  
leaves (so that people don't get confused and think that leaves can  
only occur at maximum depth, which is a mistake I've seen before in  
my students).  You're welcome to use it if you like (credit would be  
appreciated)."
