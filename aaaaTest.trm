# the definition
@DEFN=(1) This is a test term to check processing.  It should not be
in the final release.  It has all the strangest, hardest examples and
test cases I've found.
(2) This is definition two.  A {node} \{this should not cause problems}
some {B-trees} are big.  {P-tree}(2),

Entering LaTeX commands takes some work.  Anything between dollar
signs is considered to be a LaTeX expression and subject to
substitution.  All open curly brackets must be escaped (preceeded by a
backslash) so they aren't misinterpreted as cross references.
Subscripts (underline) and superscripts (caret) must be replaced by
the HTML sub...end-sub and sup...end-sup.  Less than and greater than
must be entered with the HTML &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;, otherwise trying
to replace them would mess up sup/end-sup.

You can surround phrases with ``LaTeX-style doubled quotes'' or
"doublequotes" it doesn't matter: there is a hard-wired conversion
from LaTeX-style doubled quotes into doublequotes. 
Putting $``LaTeX-style doubled quotes''$ in math mode markers (paired
dollar signs) should make them doublequotes, too.

Here is a sample:
$\int\sqrt\{5} < \rho \div \left\{ \overline\{S}<sup>T</sup> \right\} \pm \mu$
but in the limiting case we have
$42\lambda \cdot \infty \in \{\cal Q}\cup\{\bf P}\mbox\{and}\log\Re$.
Here is an example of the crude math array handling.  This is supposed
to be combination (n over 2): 
$\delta\bigtriangleup\Delta\left(\begin\{array}\{c}n\\2\end\{array}\right)$

@XREFS=Both ${\omega}(n)$ and {$\omega$}(n) should be found,
{B-tree},   {treesort (1)},{treesort (2)},
{R<sup>+</sup>-tree},{R<sup>*</sup>-tree}, 
{Merge sort} should be found--mkterms changes initial upper case to
lower case
{linked lists} should be ok--removes trailing s

# Historical note 
@HISTORY=This entry is used to test every feature.  I created it first
when I was trying to get the Latex-to-HTML working.  I tried to cover
every case.  When I need to test, I put a copy in Terms.  Afterward I
need to remember to remove it.
